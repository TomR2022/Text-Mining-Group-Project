3x01 : Dude Ranch

Mitchell : But he thought that Cam's version was a little too "artsy," so we've
decided to take a few rugged shots at the ranch to, you know, balance it out.

Captain : We're beginning our initial descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Thank you for flying United.

Cameron : I don't think it need balancing out.

Phil : Reckon we'll be landing soon.

Cameron : It's called "Production value."

Mitchell : Really?

Claire : Phil, honey, you promised... not till we got there.
[OPENING CREDITS]
Phil : This year, we're going to a dude ranch with the whole family.
Claire : Mm-hmm. The family.

Mitchell : Horse.
Gloria : Look, Jay! So beautiful!

Haley : What if Dylan buys his own ticket? We'll be sleeping in separate
cabins.

Jay : Your ears haven't popped yet, huh?

Phil : What if Dylan and I share a horse?

Gloria : I'm like the horse whisperer. But something is making this one
skittish.

Claire : Mm, I hate landing.

Dylan : Whoa. Look at the mountains.

Dylan : We'll get through this.

Haley : They're amazing.
Dylan : I've never been this far from home before now I've never been this far.

Gloria : Wow! Oh, my goodness.

Claire : Where's a cliff when you need one?

Jay : What are you doing?

Jay : Look, kids! A real life cowboy!

Gloria : I want my ears to pop.

Luke : Oh. Come see. Come see.

Manny : Try putting a little Rouge on 'em. Nobody gets me.

Claire : Uh-oh.

Mitchell : Wow. Isn't this beautiful, little cowgirl?

Luke : What's he doing?

Cameron : You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?

Claire : Oh, my.

Mitchell : No, I told you, it's fine. I just didn't like you wearing a matching
one.

Hank : My name is Hank. Here at the Lost Creek Ranch, you're gonna ride,
you're gonna rope, and you're gonna shoot. You're gonna see a sky so full of
stars, it'll put your city lights to shame. And when it's all done, you might just
encounter a piece of yourselves you never knew was there. Are there any
questions?

Mitchell : So we haven't told the family yet, but we've decided to adopt a baby
boy.
Cameron : From America this time. You might say we're "buying domestic."
Mitchell : In private... You might say that in private.
Cameron : Our adoption attorney told us it would be a good idea to make a
photo book to show prospective moms.

Manny : Uh, do we book spa treatments through you or...
Hank : I like you, kid. I'm gonna call you "Hollywood."
Manny : That wasn't an answer.
Hank : And who's this cactus flower?
Modern Family Season 3x01 page.1

Gloria : What?
Jay : That's my wife Gloria.
Hank : Well, she's "Cactus Flower" now, old-timer.
Jay : These, uh, these nicknames... are they set in stone?
Hank : Okey dokey. You ready, gunslinger?
Phil : I heard word of trouble in these parts. Pull! That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?
Jay : You got a piece of it.
Phil : I've been practicing like crazy, all my cowboy skills... shootin', ropin'.
pancake eatin'. Why? Because sometimes I feel like Jay doesn't respect me as a
man.

Mitchell : I realized that if I was gonna raise a boy, I needed to butch up my
life. You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son all the things that my Dad
taught Claire.
Luke : Hey, Hollywood.
Manny : I don't love that.
Luke : Wanna see something?
Manny : Oh, my gosh. Is that a firecracker?
Luke : Shh! Now I just need to find the perfect thing to blow up.
Manny : Is that thing even legal?

Phil : It's just that when you say, "Phil is my son-in-law," it sounds like you're
saying, "Phyllis, my son-in-law."

Luke : Not here. It's from Germany. If they had this during the war, right now
we'd all be knee-deep in strudel.

Jay : That's ridiculous.

Alex : Watch it!

Phil :Okay, who's your son-in-law?

Jimmy : What you doing, eh? You readin'?

Jay : Phyllis.

Alex : Trying to.

Phil : I'm not asking for a hug. I just want to get that look of newfound respect,
like... Or... Or... mm. Yeah.

Jimmy : I'm not so good at it either.
Alex : I'm not surprised.

Phil : Check it out. Two birds, one leg. Pull it! Not bad, eh, Old-timer?

Jimmy : That was a joke. I'm Jimmy Scrivano. You want to see me do a
cannonball?

Hank : Uh, see, slappy only had three fingers.

Alex : I'd rather see you get hit by one, but...

Gloria : What?

Jimmy : Ha. Good one, gorgeous.

Hank : He only had three fingers. Who's next?
Mitchell : Oh, me. Me.
Cameron : Oh, this is good. This is good. Tres macho. No smile. Don't smile.
Good.
Hank : You ready?
Mitchell : Wait. Do I say "pull"? Sorry. Sorry.
Jay : Mitchell, why don't you go find Manny at the spa? Wouldn't that be more
fun?
Mitchell : Yeah.

Gloria : Jay! Is this like the lobster?! Do I get to pick one for dinner? Because
this one looks very tender.
Hank : Look alive, Old-timer. One of your calves is getting away.
Jay : Hey, something's wrong with my horse. She's veering left. When this
happened to my Uncle, it was a stroke.
Hank : Oh, there's nothing wrong with Buttercup. You just gotta let her know
who's boss! Beautiful form, Cactus Flower! Beautiful! You look like a dadgum
conquistadora!
Jay : She's deaf, but I can hear ya.
Modern Family Season 3x01 page.2

Cameron : Why are you riding that way?
Mitchell : I'm afraid that cow over there might bite me.

Alex : Okay, Lily, I'm going to push you one more time. Now don't kick me,
okay? Aah! Oh! Lily! I said don't kick me. Okay?

Cameron : Oh, yes, he's gonna come up and bite you because your leg looks so
desirable with those... are those canvas?

Jimmy : You know it's your own fault that's happening. Why don't you try
standing behind her?

Claire : Okay, Phil, ease that one back over towards me.

Alex : You are an idiot.

Phil : Got it.

Jimmy : Oh, really? I ain't the one getting kicked.

Claire : Ease him back this way.

Alex : Why are you following me?

Phil : Hey! Piece of cake, huh, Jay? Huh?

Jimmy : Why are you fighting me here, gorgeous? This works.

Hank : Ease that one over to Bossy.

Alex : I really, really don't appreciate you calling me "gorgeous." I just want to
enjoy time with my family, so if you don't mind... mm!

Phil : Which one's Bossy?
Hank : That's my nickname for your wife.
Phil : Hilarious.
Haley : Go, Mom! Whoo!
Dylan : Yeah, Mom! You rock!
Claire : Oh, I wish I had a rock.
Phil : Hey. It wouldn't kill you to be nice to Dylan.
Claire : It might. But, honey, I don't know why you always stick up for him.
Haley can do so much better.

Jimmy : Not a problem. See you around, sunshine.
Lily : You kissed a boy!
Alex : No, the boy kissed me. Okay, Lily? The boy kissed me.
Dylan : ♪ I rode a horse for the first time today wasn't surprised when it
went... neigh ♪
Claire : Okay. Hey, Dylan.
Dylan : Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.

Phil : Because I know what it's like to fall for a girl whose dad thinks I'm not
good enough.

Claire : I was wondering if we could have a little chat.

Claire : All right, you're right. I can make more of an effort.

Claire : No, no. It's the... the opposite of that.

Phil : That's the woman I love.

Dylan : I want you to go home?

Hank : We taking a little break over here? Laying some pipe.

Claire : No, I, um, I want you to know how glad I am that you're here.

Phil : No. Sorry. I was just talking to Bossy.

Dylan : Really? 'Cause sometimes I just get this vibe you don't like me.

Hank : Uh-huh.

Claire : Oh. Dylan, no. I'm sorry. I-I like you. I-I like you a lot. I just... It's
complicated because Haley's my daughter.

Claire : Phil!
Phil : I'm sorry.
Gloria : Jay, look! I got this one! I got this one!
Jay : She's veering left again. When we get back, I'm gonna see if she can track
a pencil with her eyes.

Dylan : Oh. You want me to go home.

Dylan : Whoa. Whoa, whoa. You are totally a hot mom, but I can't do this.
Claire : Oh, my God. Okay, we... there's... no, no. I merely meant that I'm sorry
if I made you feel unwelcome.
Dylan : Whew! That would have been awkward.
Claire : So awkward.
Modern Family Season 3x01 page.3

Dylan : You know, but for the record, Mrs. Dunphy...

Mitchell : I-I'm s... I'm not sure if we should have another baby.

Claire : Yes?

Cameron : What? Are you serious?

Dylan : If Haley wasn't my girlfriend...

Mitchell : I think that we might be rushing into this.

Claire : Yeah.

Cameron : Rushing into... we've been working...

Dylan : And Mr. Dunphy was out of the picture...

Dylan : Everybody, it's me, Dylan. I just wanted to thank you all for bringing
me on this trip and making me feel like one of the family, uh, especially Bossy.
So I can't think of a better time to ask something of the woman that I love.
Okay.

Claire : Mm-hmm.
Dylan : I would be honored to share your bed and raise Luke, Alex, and Haley
as my own.
Claire : Okay. Good talk.
Gloria : ♪ She'll be running down the mountain. she'll be running down the
Mountain when she comes ♪
Jay : The song ended two minutes ago.
Hank : Well, I'll tell you what. She could play Evita.
Jay : Really? You notice the crickets left? Anyone want more water?
Mitchell : Oh, Dad, I'll take one.

Claire : No, no.
Dylan : Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy, will you do me the honors of being my
lawfully wedded...
Claire : No. No, no, no, no, no. No proposals. Not now. Not gonna happen.
She's a child, so...
Haley : Mom!
Claire : You're still in high school!
Dylan : I meant after she graduates.

Claire : Oh, my gosh.

Claire : Not then. Not now. Not ever. Seriously, what are you two gonna live
off of? The... the... the royalties from the horsey song? Put it back in your
pocket.

Mitchell : Oh. It was... it was dark. I-I couldn't see it. Thank you.

Haley : Would you stop it?

Jay : Heads up.

Claire : No, I won't. I won't.
Manny : So did you set off the firecracker yet?
Luke : When I do, you won't have to ask. First, all the electronics will go out,
then comes the heat flash. Afterwards, the living will envy the dead.

Dylan : No, it's okay. I guess I'll just turn in. Just so you know, there's a fan in
my cabin that sounds like someone crying.
Haley : Dylan, wait! I hate you!

Manny : And yet I'm the one on the "No-fly" list.

Claire : Oh, come on. Haley, get back here! Phil, anything?

Cameron : You know what? Maybe next time I'll just catch it and then hand it
to you.

Phil : I think you said it all, Claire. You want me to rope her? I can, you know.

Mitchell : Oh, okay. Yeah, let's do that. You... you do everything, and I'll do
nothing.
Cameron : Something on your mind?
Mitchell : This isn't the right place to talk about it.
Cameron : Okay.

Hank : For what it's worth, my second wife was in high school.
Cameron : Sweetie, here. Here we go. One, two, three. One, two, three. Gone.
Lily : It's gone! It's over there!
Cameron : It's not back there.
Lily : We counted to three.
Modern Family Season 3x01 page.4

Cameron : Yes.

Manny : Doubt it. He left his luggage.

Mitchell : Hey.

Haley : We have to do something. If he doesn't eat five times a day, he gets
spacey.

Cameron : Where have you been?
Mitchell : I-I slept on the couch in the lodge. I know you didn't want to have a
big fight last night.

Claire : What would that even look like?

Cameron : Well, I'm ready now.

Hank : What seems to be the trouble?

Mitchell : Cam, I'm sorry. Look, what if I can't do the father-son stuff? The
hunting, the... the sports, the Three Stooges? You know what happens in real
life when someone gets hit in the head with a ladder? They go to the hospital
and they get an MRI. Never see that scene.

Alex : We need to talk.

Cameron : I think you're overthinking this. You know, I love sports, I love the
Stooges. We've got this covered.
Mitchell : No. No, you... you got it covered, but I'm just stuck on the sidelines,
pretending to understand the rules, and... You know, my dad was a roughand-tumble guy, and I just... I could never relate to him. And I don't know. I
just don't think I could handle disappointing... two generations.

Phil : We'll find him. Hank? We got a situation here!

Jimmy : What?
Alex : You stole my first kiss.
Jimmy : What are you talkin' about?
Alex : I had it all planned out. It was supposed to be special, someone with a
high GPA and a bright future, not a Mario brother.
Jimmy : Fine. You know what? I don't even want your kiss. Here, you can
have it back. There. Now we're even.
Alex : Well, keep it. I don't... I don't want it anymore. What am I doing?

Cameron : I think you're more masculine than you give yourself credit for.
Mitchell : Who puts a birdhouse next to a porch?
Gloria : Claire, I know that you're worried that Dylan is gonna break Haley's
heart, but I see in his eyes that he's gonna stick with her forever. No matter
what, he's always going to be with her. On your deathbed...
Claire : Okay. All right. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna go find her.
Jay : No. You push too hard, you chase her right into his arms, you'll end up
with a boob for a son-in-law. Believe me, you don't want that.

Hank : Okay, people. Looks like we have a walker. Right now he is facing
treacherous terrain, sudden drops, mountain lions hungry bears, oh, and
wolverines. That is, if the hypothermia didn't already get him. Why did we
come here again? So our best bet is to split up. You two are gonna take the
North hiking trail.
Haley : Can I go with my Dad instead?
Hank : Negative. I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer... To check the Snake River.
Phil : Buffalo Phil... worth the wait.

Phil : What's that supposed to mean?

Hank : Me and Cactus Flower will ride on up to Destiny Ridge.

Jay : What?

Jay : Maybe I should ride up there with her.

Haley : Hey, have you guys seen Dylan?

Hank : Negatory. That trail is for advanced riders only. We don't need another
dead body.

Claire : No. No. Why?
Haley : I'm not talking to you. He said he was going out for a walk last night,
and no one's seen him since.
Phil : Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine. Maybe after last night, he just went home.

Haley : "Another"?
Hank : Let's go! Move 'em out.
Jay : Phil, help me saddle my horse, will ya?
Phil : Well, look who's suddenly needed by his father-in-law. Phyllis. Phil... is.
Modern Family Season 3x01 page.5

Luke : Hey, Uncle Mitch. Whatcha doing?

your daughter and a great dad to your grandkids. So if we've still got a
problem, now it's your problem.

Mitchell : Oh, hey. Just... just thinkin'.

Jay : Phil, wait up. Let me ask you something, man to man.

Luke : You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you're a super fun Uncle. And
I'm saying this as a boy.

Phil : Okay.

Mitchell : Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?

Phil : Gloria? Yeah, He's hitting on her. Why?

Luke : What? That's hilarious. No, I love how you and me can joke like this.

Jay : I knew it.

Mitchell : Okay, Luke, look, I don't know how much Cam told you, but I don't
think this is a problem that you can help me with. It's...

Phil : Where are you going?

Jay : You notice anything funny about the... Hank character and, uh...

Jay : Destiny Ridge. Buttercup, ha! Buttercup, hiya! Seriously?

Luke : Okay, good. I've got my own problem.
Mitchell : What? What's that?

Mitchell : Okay. Okay, it's clear.

Luke : Can you keep a secret?

Luke : After this, we're gonna have some angry birds.

Mitchell : I kept a pretty big one for 22 years, so...
Luke : I've got this new firecracker, and I can't decide what to blow up.

Mitchell : Yeah. It's gonna be "Bye bye Birdie." It's a big musical from the '60s.
No. Forget it. What you said. Okay. Okay, go.

Mitchell : Oh, Luke, that's dangerous.

Luke : That's it?

Luke : I know. That's what's fun about it.

Mitchell : I'm sorry, buddy.

Mitchell : I don't get boys. What is so great about destroying things?

Luke : I brought that thing all the way from... whoa!

Luke : It turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff.

Mitchell : Whoa!

Mitchell : Okay, no. No, g-give it to me. Come on, give it to me.
Luke : Fine. I take it back. You're not that fun.
Mitchell : All right, hey, look, um, we'll do it together, all right?

Mitchell : Cam, I did a boy thing! I blew up the birdhouse! You should have
seen it. It was so awesome.

Luke : You just made the best decision of your life.

Cameron : That's great!

Mitchell : Okay. Come on.

Mitchell : Yeah. I think I can do this. I mean, maybe not everything and maybe
not right away, and not the three stooges...

Jay : Damn it! Buttercup! What the hell's wrong with this horse?
Phil : Jay. Wow. I want to talk to you about that son-in-law crack you made at
breakfast.
Jay : Oh, I didn't mean anything by that.
Phil : I think you did. I get that I wasn't your first choice to marry Claire, but
it's been 18 years, and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't a loyal husband to

Cameron : No.
Mitchell : I do. I want a son. I'm sorry I panicked.
Cameron : Oh, that's great. Now maybe we can go back to taking pictures for
the book.
Mitchell : Yes! Pictures of me blowing up stuff!
Cameron : Okay, I see we've overcorrected.

Modern Family Season 3x01 page.6

Claire : I know you think I'm the mean mom who wouldn't let you marry your
boyfriend, but someday you're gonna realize, I-I did what had to be done.

Gloria : Dylan!

Haley : No, you didn't. I was never gonna marry Dylan. I told him no. But it
was my proposal to turn down. You know, you keep telling me to act like an
adult, but then you don't even give me a chance.

Gloria : Dylan! He ain't down there.

Claire : Oh. You sort of got me there. But, sweetheart, I don't expect you to
understand this. I certainly didn't when I was your age. I look at you as my
baby, and I always will. It's... it's just what moms do.

Hank : Yeah, I sure am worried about that kid.
Hank : Oh, come on now. You come up here for the cowboy experience. You're
looking at him.
Gloria : Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?
Hank : Yes.

Haley : I'm not a baby anymore! Okay? And I am never gonna see Dylan
again! Dylan! Dylan!

Gloria : Really?

Dylan : What?!

Phil : Only we touch our women when they don't want us to.

Haley : Where are you?!

Hank : Easy. Easy there, friend-o. I wasn't hitting on this filly. This is all part of
the package. If I didn't play the bad guy, he wouldn't get to ride up and be the
big hero.

Dylan : Wyoming!
Haley : You're okay!
Dylan : I had the craziest night. When you rejected me, I felt lost and scared.
And then I went out on a walk, and I felt a whole different kind of lost and
scared. And then I fell asleep in the stable. And when I woke up, I met this
woman named Jake who's strong like a man. Then we had this long talk, and
he/she hired me.
Haley : Uh, what... what do you mean, she hired you?

Jay : Hey! I think you better move away from that woman.

Gloria : He doesn't need you to make him a hero. He's a hero every day.
Jay : Why don't you do us all a favor? Get back on your horse, ride down to
the lodge and tell 'em.... Can you keep him still? I'm trying to make a point.
Phil : I am.
Hank : Okay. Okay, I'm gone. Ma'am.

Dylan : I work here now.

Phil : Wait. Wait. There's something I wanna say to you. I will only be
checking "somewhat satisfied" on our comment card.

Haley : S-so you're staying?

Jay : Jeez.

Dylan : Yeah.

Phil : I mean, he was great with the kids.

Haley : What about us?

Alex : I looked it up. The distance between our houses is 2,443 miles.

Dylan : It could never work. We're from two different worlds. You're a high
school student, and I'm a ranch hand.

Jimmy : Yeah, but, you know, on some maps, it's like... pfft! This big.

Claire : I'm just... I'm so glad you're okay. I really am. I am.
Claire : Right.

Phil : All in all, it was a great vacation. We may have lost a man... But out there
on the range, under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we never
knew was there, just like the horny cowboy said we would.

Gloria : Dylan! Dylan!

Mitchell : No.

Hank : You got a voice like a meadowlark, don't ya?

Cameron : Fine.

Dylan : Thanks. But we're not supposed to fraternize with the guests.

Alex : God, you're stupid.

Modern Family Season 3x01 page.7

3x02 : When Good Kids Go Bad
Claire : Okay, let's see... Oh, could you grab me an extra virgin...

Mitchell : We are having a slight issue getting Lily on board with the
adoption. "I hate the baby."

Phil : I think one's enough for the sacrifice.

Cameron : "No new baby."

Claire : Olive oil, Phil.

Mitchell : "I wanna make the baby dead."

Phil : Come on. That's funny.

Cameron : I thought we weren't gonna share that one.

Claire : Oh, it's funnier than your freestyle "sandwich rap."

Mitchell : I-I-I just hope that the problem is she hasn't spent much time with
any babies.

Phil : Girl, you crazy. I'm mad fun to shop with. ♪ Trapped in between two
whole wheat slices. Pastrami and Swiss are my only vices. ♪
Claire : Sweetie, my shoe. Come on. Jesus. God.
Phil : Hello.
Woman : Hi.
Phil : Oh, roadblock. Beep beep! Pardon me.
Woman : Oh!
Phil : Are you okay?
Claire : Actually, not okay. Not okay.
Phil : Honey, did you pull from the bottom again?
Cameron : So after hors d'oeuvres, we'll bring everyone in here to share the
news.
Cameron : We're having the family over tomorrow night to tell them we're
planning on adopting a new baby.
Mitchell : Yes, and we both agreed to... to go a little more low-key with the
announcement this time.
Mitchell : Okay, just to be clear, this is low-key?

Cameron : So we thought it would be a great idea to show her how much fun
it'll be to have one around.
Mitchell : Oh, he is so cute!
Woman : Yeah, and he never cries. Literally never. It's actually a little weird.
Cameron : Oh, no, that's not weird. My sister was born with a full set of teeth.
Mitchell : Yeah, that never happened.
Cameron : Oh. No? Really? You should've seen her crib. It looked like beavers
lived there.
Woman : Oh, is this Lily?
Mitchell : Oh, yes, it is. Hey, honey. Say hi to the baby.
Lily : My Daddy!
Mitchell : Oh! Okay, so that's one problem solved.
[OPENING CREDITS]
Cameron : Bye! See you soon! Or never.
Mitchell : Cam, I'm a little freaked out about what Lily did.
Cameron : Oh, please. She barely touched him, and he went from zero to big
crybaby.

Cameron : It's a banner and just some light musical accompaniment, Mitchell.
I don't have a lower key. Besides, this is a happy occasion. Am I right, Lily?
Aren't you excited to get a new baby brother?

Mitchell : We're talking about bringing another child into this house. How's
that gonna work with Lily being so possessive of you?

Lily : No! I hate the baby!

Mitchell : Oh, come on. You have to admit that you do coddle her.

Cameron : Why am I hearing an accusatory tone?

Modern Family Season 3x02 page.1

Cameron : I will not apologize for loving our daughter.
Mitchell : I'm not criticizing. I'm not only criticizing, but we did talk about
giving Lily a little more independence.

Alex : Could you "L" a little less "O L"? Don't you see what I'm trying to do
here?
Haley : Die alone?

Cameron : Yeah, which is why we put her in preschool.

Claire : Girls, dinner!

Mitchell : Yes, but you can't bear to leave her there. You always pick her up
early.

Alex : You know, why does Luke get his own room, and I still have to share
with you? I can't take it anymore.

Cameron : That is ridiculous.

Haley : Me either, even if it is just for one more year... When I leave for college.

Mitchell : Okay. Okay. Lily, honey, did daddy pick you up early from
preschool today?

Alex : Is it one more year or when you leave for college? Because those happen
to be two different things.

Lily : No.
Cameron : Case closed.
Lily : We didn't go.

Phil : So I hear this little voice coming from the cans and it's like... "Help! I fell
in the peaches!"

Mitchell : Case opened.

Luke : That's Mom! Hilarious!

Lily : We went shopping.

Phil : So hilarious. I'm like, "Claire?"

Cameron : That's enough.

Claire : You might wanna tell them that it was you who pushed me into the
peaches in the first place.

Lily : We bought matchy hats.
Cameron : You are going to your room.
Mitchell : You're both going to her room.
Cameron : Do we spend a lot of time together? Yes Do we have a special
bond? Absolutely. But do I coddle her more than any other loving parent? It's
possible. And for Lily's sake, I should probably work on that.

Phil : This again? I wasn't even near you.
Claire : Yes, you were! You knocked me with the cart. It was completely your
fault.
Phil : Well, let's just agree to disagree.
Claire : No. I-I disagree to disagree.
Phil : Then you agree.
Claire : No. No, I don't, because I'm right.

Gloria : No, you calm down! This is how I talk when somebody accuses my
Manny of stealing.

Phil : Okay, Claire. You're right.

Jay : Who is that?

Claire : No, I am right.

Gloria : It's the principal. He's saying that Manny stole some girl's locket.
What, do you think that all Colombians are criminals because a Colombian
necktie is a symbol of violence all over the world? No, no, I'm not threatening
you. Okay. Apology accepted. No, I didn't mean anything about the necktie. I
just... I was trying to make a point.

Haley : Like always.

Haley : As usual.

Claire : Stop it. When I am wrong, I admit it.
Luke : Which is never.
Claire : Fine. Fine.

Modern Family Season 3x02 page.2

Manny : Aah!
Jay : You're a little jumpy tonight, Manny. Anything wrong?
Manny : No. Well, I'm just gonna...
Jay : Have a seat, kid. You know, maybe it's me, but I thought you were kinda
squirrelly tonight, you know, before when your mom was on the phone with
the principal. Almost like you wanted to say something... But you just
couldn't. Anything you wanna say now, Manny?

Gloria : You stole the locket. After I told the principal that you could have
never done something like that, and I threaten him with the Colombian
necktie! Manny, why?
Jay : Don't worry. It wasn't 'cause he wanted to wear it.
Manny : I thought I could keep it as something to remember her by. But then
you were yelling at Mr. Vickers, and I-I was just too scared to tell you.
Gloria : Go to the car.

Manny : No. I have nothing to say.

Manny : I'm really sorry.

Jay : You sure about that? Think real hard.

Gloria : Go. Why would he do something like that? It's bad enough that he's
the boy with the pan flute and the puffy shirts and... and the poems. Now he's
the jewelry thief.

Manny : Could I get a glass of water?
Jay : That girl's locket... you took it, didn't you?
Manny : Um...
Jay : Didn't you?
Manny : Yes. Yes, I took it. I didn't mean to.
Jay : I don't wanna hear any excuses. You're gonna tell your mom, and you're
gonna set this right. Do you understand? All right, get out of here. Just one
more thing. You're not, um... You're not wearing that locket, are you?
Manny : No. Of course not. It's a girl's. Why would I want to wear it?
Jay : No reason.

Jay : Might be an upgrade.
Gloria : Ay, Jay, this is not funny. Those things stick to you. My cousin Rosa
Marina, when she was 14, she stole something, and after that, everybody
thinks of her as the girl who steals cars.
Jay : She stole a car?
Gloria : Cars. But after she got that label, what else could she do?
Jay : Listen, you can't control what kids think, but you can make sure he learns
from this. You take him to the principal's office, he owns up to it, he never
does it again.
Gloria : Okay. Okay. But what was he thinking? This is not even real gold.

Manny : Mom, hurry up! I don't want to be late for school.
Jay : You didn't tell her, did you?

Alex : No way, Haley! It was my idea! I'm taking this room!

Gloria : What's the hurry this morning? Okay, what's with the looks? It's like a
silent movie in here.

Haley : Over my dead body! This is going to be my room, and there's nothing
you can do about it!

Manny : Okay. I was walking behind this girl Alicia, who's moving away, and
I was working up the courage to get her new address so I can write her. I
express myself a lot better on paper than...

Alex : Seriously?

Jay : Tick-tock, kid.
Manny : Well, she dropped her locket, and I picked it up, but she kept
walking, and I...

Luke : What are you guys fighting about?
Haley : Okay, so we both think that this would make a totally awesome
bedroom.
Alex : But only one of us can have it. Don't you think it should be me?
Haley : Oh, so not. It should be me. Right, Luke?
Luke : Why do you guys wanna move into the attic?
Modern Family Season 3x02 page.3

Haley : Oh, you mean "the penthouse"?

Lily : I push the buttons, Daddy.

Alex : With all the privacy of being on its very own floor?

Cameron : You certainly do.

Luke : It is kinda cool.
Luke : I'm not an idiot. I knew what they were up to, but I've been wanting to
move for a while. There's a line of ants going to a trick-or-treat bag in my
closet, and I don't want to still be there when they get tired of candy.

Manny : What do you think the principal's going to do to me? I am a first-time
offender. Oh, great. Now I'm tardy. Strike two.
Gloria : Manny, think of this in a positive way, like it is your "ha ha" moment.
Manny : What does that mean?
Gloria : That means that one day, you're gonna laugh about it.

Mitchell : Good morning, princess. Good morning, Lily.
Cameron : Very adorable, Mitchell, but I'm having kind of a rough morning,
Lily : Daddy, up.

Manny : Ah, I should've just given that stupid necklace back to Alicia when
she was standing right next to her locker. This is the worst day of my life, till
tomorrow...

Cameron : I'm sorry, Lily, those days are over. Now here's your lunch. Go get
your bag. We will be leaving shortly.

Gloria : Oh.

Mitchell : Cam, you don't have to ice her out completely.

Gloria : Wait.

Cameron : Do you think I'm enjoying this? But I need her to detach from me
before the new thing comes or who knows what she'll do to it.

Manny : What?

Mitchell : Why are you saying "thing" instead of "baby"?

Manny : Mm-hmm. The one that smells like rose oil. Mom?

Lily : Kill the new baby.

Gloria : Keep the lookout. Now promise me that you will never, ever do
anything dishonest again.

Mitchell : Oh. Um, look, I-I-I know this is hard, but I really appreciate what
you're doing. And believe me, I take no pleasure in seeing you suffer like this.
Mitchell : I take a little pleasure. No, but there--there are very few parenting
issues where I come out on top. You know, I'm distant. I work too much. My
French braiding is "sloppy." Finally, you know, something that isn't my fault.
Lily : Ready.
Cameron : Okay. Could you please just go put her in her car seat while I
compose myself?
Mitchell : All right, you know what, Cam? Why don't I just take Lily to
preschool on my way to work?
Cameron : I think that would be best. Let me just whip up a smoothie for you
before you go.

Manny : And every day after that. Come on, Mom. Let's get this over with.

Gloria : Which one did you say that it was her locker? This one?

Manny : I promise.
Gloria : Okay, because that's not the way I raised you. Don't tell Jay anything,
okay?
Manny : Mnh-mnh.
Elaine : Hi, Lily.
Mitchell : All right, Lily.
Elaine : Hi.
Mitchell : Have fun, sweetheart. Bye.
Elaine : She is so sweet.
Mitchell : Oh, thanks. Well, you should've seen her yesterday. Yeah, she
pushed a baby off of Cam's lap.
Modern Family Season 3x02 page.4

Elaine : Huh.
Mitchell : I know. I know. She is so possessive of him, but, you know, Cam's
really working on trying not to coddle her so much, So...
Elaine : Mm-hmm. I'm not really sure it's about coddling. Sounds more like a
sharing issue. You know, we've noticed Lily has a hard time with that.

Claire : Well, don't get too comfortable in there, girls. Luke, it's cold, and it's
scary up there. You're gonna be back in your own room by tomorrow night.
Phil : I don't know, Claire. It's got a lot of potential. This is a lot nicer than the
attic I lived in when we met.
Claire : One night, if that. Trust me on this.

Mitchell : Really?

Haley : Oh, yes, because you're always right.

Elaine : I wouldn't worry. Kids usually pick that habit up from other kids,
except the ones that pick it up from their parents. We have a few of those in
here. Of course, I can't share those names with you... Until I get a glass of wine
in my hand.

Claire : Sweetheart, I would love to be wrong. I just don't live with the right
people for that.

Mitchell : Oh. Oh, miss Elaine.
Mitchell : I have been told that I might have the teensiest issue with sharing.
But is that something Lily would even pick up on?
Mitchell : My chicken... My pillow.
Cameron : Ow! Mmm.
Mitchell : Daddy's pen.
Mitchell : Okay, it's possible. And I suppose for Lily's sake, I-I should work on
that... Privately, because right now we really need to get Cam's coddling
problem under control.
Claire : What's going on?
Luke : Moving into the attic. Give me a day or two to get settled, then I'll have
you up.
Claire : When did all this happen?
Luke : Depends on who you ask. My plan's been in motion for three weeks.
Claire : Honey, this is a terrible idea. You're gonna hate it up there.
Alex : Mom, stay out of this.
Haley : Yeah. We all have our own rooms now. Everybody wins.

Phil : Let it go, kids. She's not gonna budge. Kept me up all night with the...
Claire : Phil, you did push me!
Phil : Your word against mine. Guess it's one of those things we'll just never
know, like what really happened to the "Titanic."
Claire : It hit an iceberg.
Phil : Maybe.
Claire : Mm, there's no maybe.
Phil : Oh, you're right, Claire.
Haley : Again.
Luke : Surprise, surprise.
Claire : Okay, I-I will see you over at Uncle Mitchell's. I'm gonna skip this
meeting of the "Pile on Claire club".
Phil : Guess I pushed her into that pile, too.
Jay : I spend half my life waiting on you. How many times do you have to
change your outfit?
Manny : Sorry, Jay. Too many choices is a prison.
Gloria : Just drive before he rethinks the pants.
Manny : What's wrong with my pants?!
Gloria : Go. Go. Go.
Jay : So, Manny, how'd it go with the principal today?
Gloria : It was terrible, but he was brave, and now it's over. Right, Manny?
Manny : Mm-hmm.
Modern Family Season 3x02 page.5

Gloria : Mm. So d...

Lily : My Daddy!

Jay : What'd they give you? Detention? Suspension?

Mitchell : Lily, no! I-I'm sorry, Luke.

Gloria : No, just a warning because it was first offense. So how was work?

Luke : This isn't over.

Jay : Great. Just a warning, huh?

Cameron : Oh, my God. Mitchell, she's getting worse. I have turned her into a
pushy, little, entitled monster on her way to a rap sheet and a bracelet on her
ankle. Oh, she has a bracelet on her ankle.

Manny : Like she said.
Gloria : So I ask about work, and you change the subject.
Jay : Are you trying to hide something?
Gloria : No, I just wanna make sure he's okay.
Jay : You okay? 'Cause, I mean, it looks like you're sweatin' bullets back there,
kid.
Gloria : Stop grilling him. First the principal, now you. This poor boy has been
screamed at all day.
Manny : Well, not to mention...
Gloria : Quiet! I've got this.
Gloria : Where is Lily?
Cameron : Um, she's getting dressed.
Claire : All by herself?
Mitchell : Cam is encouraging her to be more independent. Oh. And there she
is!
Claire : Ah! Ah!
Mitchell : Doesn't she look beautiful?

Mitchell : Cam. Cam, Cam, This... this might not be entirely your fault.
Cameron : No, it is.
Mitchell : I spoke with Lily's teacher, and she thinks that--that she may have a
problem with sharing, which she might have gotten from...
Cameron : You. You don't like to share.
Mitchell : No, I do it to make a point sometimes. Like, if you want the chicken,
then order the chicken.
Cameron : Wait, when did you talk to Lily's teacher?
Mitchell : Uh, today, when I--when I dropped her off at school.
Cameron : And you let me suffer all day?
Mitchell : All right, look, we... we can't do this with everybody here. Can we
please just get through the evening?
Cameron : Yes, but we are not making the announcement tonight because that
is a joyful thing, and I am not feeling very joyful right now.
Mitchell : Well, I share your feeling.

Cameron : She looks like she was dipped in glue and dragged through a flea
market.

Jay : Just so you know, I'm on to you. You never took Manny to the principal.
Okay, play it like that, but I know Manny. He has more of a conscience than
you have. He's not gonna be able to live with this.

Alex : Hey there!

Gloria : You'd be surprised what people can live with, Jay.

Mitchell : Hi, guys. Come on in. How's it going?
Luke : Hey, do you guy have any old furniture? I'm moving into the attic.

Claire : Hi, miss Lily. How's my big girl doing?

Mitchell : The attic?

Lily : Good.

Luke : Hey, at least it's big. Grandpa said you used to live in the closet.

Claire : Can you tell me how old you are now?

Cameron : Oh. Okay. Well, you know what? Yeah, we'll absolutely find you
something for sure. Okay?

Lily : Three.
Claire : That's four. This is three. Okay, show me again. How old are you?
Modern Family Season 3x02 page.6

Lily : Three.
Claire : No! That many is four. This many is three.
Phil : Don't argue, Lily. You'll never win.
Claire : Really, Phil? Okay, I-I was gonna wait until we got home for this, but
now I think it's something everyone's gonna enjoy. Guys, everybody, come on
down to the TV room. I've got something really special to share.

Cameron : Yes, children are very impressionable. You'll never know what
they'll pick up.
Mitchell : Okay, Cam, I'm sorry that I blamed it on you, okay? But we both
need to look at our actions. I mean, if we're thinking about adopting another
baby, then we need to...
Phil : You guys... you're adopting another kid?

Cameron : Okay, how's everybody on drinks?

Mitchell : No! No, no! You're...

Gloria : If this is Alex's graduation again, just leave me the bottle.

Cameron : wait!

Jay : I'm good, Cam.

Gloria : Congratulations!

Claire : Okay, everybody. Showtime.

Mitchell : We're thinking about it. It's not...

Phil : Oh, my gosh. It's us at the market. How did you...

Claire : Oh, wow!

Claire : Uh-huh. Yeah, it's security camera footage.

Jay : What the hell's happening here?

Mitchell : I don't understand. What are we watching?

Phil : Is that from "Footloose"?

Jay : It ain't "The Godfather," I can tell you that much.

Cameron : Really, Mitchell? You couldn't even share telling your family! Fine.
Fine.

Claire : Okay, look, I fell yesterday at the market, and Phil and I have been
having a little disagreement as to what happened. Just watch. Okay, right here.
I stop to fix my shoe, and then Phil... right there. Okay. He makes way for this
very attractive woman, whom he conveniently leaves out of his retelling of the
story. Now right here, Phil backs up, pushes his butt into the cart, pushes me
into the cans! Do you see that?! It's all his fault, just like I said! I was right!
Suck it!
Phil : When did you get this...
Alex : Oh, my God. That's why you wanted to come separately.
Haley : You went to all that trouble just to prove you were right?
Claire : It really wasn't that much trouble. I just went to the store, found your
friend Jordan the bag boy, who got me the manager. He gave me the address of
the off-site security office. I filled out some paperwork. Sally faxed it to
corporate. Three minutes later, I'm buying pack of DVDs and burning a copy.
Cake.

Gloria : But why are you upset? This is such good news.
Mitchell : No, we're a little on edge because Lily has been acting out like she
doesn't want a sibling, and...
Cameron : Yeah, because Mitchell taught her to hate sharing.
Mitchell : And/or because Cam wears her like a fanny pack.
Jay : Oh, stop blaming each other. No kid wants a sibling. I mean, Claire hated
you so much she stuck you in a dryer when you were two.
Mitchell : You put me in the dryer?
Claire : I did, but it wasn't 'cause I hated you. My friend Marci said that it
wouldn't run with a kid inside it, and I knew it would. I was right.
Phil : Good governor. It's been going on since you were five?
Claire: Oh, my God. It is a sickness.
Phil : Yeah.

Luke : It's like a sickness.

Claire : What would make me have that need at such a young age?

Claire : What? None of you believed me, so I got proof. You should all be
sucking it right now.

Mitchell : How long was I in that dryer? Because I... is this why I'm afraid of
tumbling? I had to quit gymnastics, Claire!

Gloria : Hey, please stop with the "sucking it," Claire. The children!

Phil : A childhood without tumbling?
Modern Family Season 3x02 page.7

Claire : Ohh.

Claire : You can spend the night tonight here if you want.

Phil : You knew this and just stood by and did nothing?!

Luke : Oh! No, if it's so important to you, I'll go now. You should come, too.
Something sleeps over there.

Jay : Okay, okay. What's done is done! All you can do is learn from your
mistakes. And in that spirit, I would like to propose a toast... to Manny. This
week, he did something he wasn't supposed to do, like we all do...

Claire : Wait for me. Wait. Wait for me! Wait for me.

Gloria : Like we all do! Salud to Manny!
Jay : Uh, not yet. But Manny stood up like a man. He admitted he was wrong
and he took his licks, and I'm damn proud of him.
Gloria : Ah, now we clink!
Jay : No, we clink when I say we clink. So Manny made a mistake, but he
didn't take the easy way out. He's got guts, he's got integrity. As far as I'm
concerned, he's the best little b...
Manny : Okay, stop! Stop! I didn't do any of that. Mom broke into the locker
and threw the necklace inside, and then we ran away like cowards. I'm sorry,
Jay! I'm sorry!
Jay : I knew it! I was right! I was right!
All : Ohh.
Luke : Who is it?
Claire : Oh! Hi, honey. It's just me. Are you okay?
Luke : Yeah. I'm great.
Claire : So, how you liking your new digs?
Luke : I know you told me that I'd be cold... And scared...
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Luke : But I'm not.
Claire : No, I can see that. I was... I was wrong.
Luke : You were.
Claire : Yeah. Well, you're gonna hate this then, honey, but I'm gonna need you
to go back down and sleep in your old room. I just... I'm worried if you get
something so cool this early in your life, you're not gonna have anything to
look forward to later.
Luke : I-I have to go now?
Modern Family Season 3x02 page.8

3x03 : Phil on Wire

Mitchell : No. No. Not the cookies.
Cameron : Of course the cookies. Why do you always want me to fail?

Gloria : Jay. Jay?
Jay : What? What's wrong?
Gloria : You're snoring.
Jay : Me? Oh, I'm sorry. I... Look at her!
Gloria : Come on, we said no Stella in the bed.
Jay : Oh, but she's just a little puppy. She probably got scared and snuck in.
Gloria : Oh, really? How come when Manny has nightmares you don't let him
snuck in the bed?
Jay : Gloria, it's 6:00 in the morning. Can we talk about this later?
Manny : Answer the question, Jay.
Mitchell : You know, I'm gonna check the lease, but I'm pretty sure we're not
allowed to have a meth lab.
Jay : You are a delight.
Mitchell : So what are you doing?
Cameron : I think you're gonna like this. I'm going on a juice fast.
Mitchell : Mmm. Love it.
Mitchell : Hate it. Let's face it, a well-fed Cam is hardly a model of emotional
stability. Now deprive him of food, and stage by stage, it's a slow descent into
madness. Stage one... the clean sweep.

Mitchell : Stage two... attack Mitchell. Because when his diet crashes and
burns into a giant pile of Nutella, I'm the one he's gonna blame. Well, no, not
this time.
Mitchell : You know what? I'm gonna do the fast with you. I think it's a great
idea, and we should do it together so we're on the same team, you know, us
versus food.
Cameron : I know what you're doing... And I really appreciate it.
Mitchell : No, it'll... it'll be good for me. I've actually put on a few pounds.
Cameron : Yeah, well, you know, I didn't want to say anything.
TV Commenter : As the stock market plummeted, brave young men took to
the skies, ushering in the golden age of the daredevil.
Phil : How awesome are people?
Luke : So awesome.
Phil : You wanna get that, buddy? I'll pause it.
Mitchell : Hey, Luke. How's it going? I...
Luke : Hey, Uncle Mitchell. I really can't talk. I'm trying to watch a movie.
Mitchell : Oh, okay, well, I just wanted to drop off this bag of junk food.
Luke : Go on.

Cameron : Poison. Poison. Poison.

Mitchell : Uh, Cam and I are on a juice fast, so having this stuff in the house...

Mitchell : Do you think that this is the best week to be doing this?

Luke : I connected the dots. See ya.

Cameron : Why not?

Mitchell : Oh.

Mitchell : Well, we have that charity thing at my boss' house.
Cameron : Oh, so what, I'm supposed to put off my quest for wellness until
we're no longer socially in demand? That will never happen. I'm too
charismatic.

Phil : Seeing that weird, wonderful little man pursuing his dream of walking
on a tightrope made me think maybe I could pursue my dream...

Modern Family Season 3x03 page.1

Phil : Here you go, buddy.

Claire : Alex, be nice to your sister. Haley, not a good save.
Haley : I knew it would suck having you at my school.

Phil : ... Of walking on a tightrope.

Claire : Well, hang in there. A couple more years, you'll have it all to yourself
again. Come on, girls.

[OPENING CREDITS]
Luke : come on, Dad! You got this! You can do this! Stay focused! Stay hungry!
Phil : You okay, buddy?
Luke : What? Yeah, hell, yeah, no. Just proud of my Dad!
Luke : There was a lot of chocolate in that bag.
Claire : Phil, honey, you gotta take Luke to school.
Phil : Got it. Okay, I haven't fallen three out of the last four times. This
afternoon, we go airborne.

Gloria : Jay, look at this. It's ruined. Stella did this. She chew on my shoe! You
have to discipline that stupid dog.
Jay : I discipline her all the time.
Gloria : Oh, really? How? By buying her little cupcakes?
Jay : They're not real cupcakes. They're doggy treats in the form of cupcakes.
Gloria : Yeah, you should have told that to Manny before he ate one.
Jay : Oh, come on. His coat never looked better.
Gloria : You wouldn't find it so funny if she was destroying your shoes.
Jay : Well, I don't leave my shoes laying around, so...
Gloria : So it's my fault that she chooses to chew my shoe?

Luke : Yeah!

Jay : I didn't say that.

Phil : Yeah! Yeah!

Gloria: : You barely said it. You have to stop coddling her.
Jay : I don't coddle her. What? She tries to drink the water. It's funny.

Haley : Sitting all by yourself at the table. Now where have I seen that again?
Oh, right. Every day in the school cafeteria.

Haley : You don't look at me in class. You don't text me.

Alex : I do that by choice.

Alex : Who would text during a class?

Haley : The school's choice.

Haley : What are you?

Alex : Isn't that your nickname?
Claire : Haley, be nice to your sister. Alex, good save.

Claire : Honey, I realize that this situation is not ideal for either one of you, but
sometimes we just rise above things. Yes?

Alex : Mom, sign this.

Circulation agent : Excuse me. Did you notice the curb here is painted yellow?

Claire : What is it? They finally bumped me up to the harder math class. Third
period, Mr. waters.

Claire : Uh, no, I did not.

Haley : What? No, Mom, you cannot sign this. This is my class. You're a
freshman. What are you doing in second-year math?

Claire : Okay, well, I was just dropping off my kids.

Alex : You're a senior. What are you still doing in second year math?

Claire : Well, we were chatting. At the risk of surprising you a third time,
officer, I've been dropping off here for years, and I...

Haley : Not "still!"... Again."

Circulation agent : Wow. It means loading and unloading.
Circulation agent : And yet I see no kids emerging from the vehicle.

Modern Family Season 3x03 page.2

Circulation agent : Move it.

Cameron : Oh. Ow. Oh.

Claire : Okay. You betcha.

Mitchell : Hey. Whatcha got there?

Alex : What was her problem?
Haley : Oh, you know what you should have said to her...
Claire : Nothing. I should have said nothing would be the point. I have to see
her every day. I mean, why make it worse? That's exactly what I'm talking
about. Awkward, unpleasant situation... Rise above. Have a nice day.
Haley : Yeah.
Claire : Love you! Bye-bye! "And yet I see no children emerging from the
vehicle." How'd you like to see my fist emerging into your face? Oh! Now I
think of it!

Mitchell : The good news is, Cam's never made it this far into a diet before,
so... Downside... I have no idea what the next stage is gonna be. But I'm pretty
sure it's not charming party guest.
Mitchell : Cam, I-I was thinking, I'll take the bullet tomorrow night at my
boss' house. You don't have to go to the party. They're... they're boring. Silly
cause, you know, lots of people. Parking... Cam, say something.
Cameron : Why do you hate me?
Mitchell : I don't hate you.

Mitchell : Day four of the juice fast, and I'm hungry, but I'm... I'm feeling
pretty good. Cam, on the other hand, has gone all... "Girl, interrupted." After
one, throwing out all of our food, and two, blaming me, he entered stage
three... soap actress.
Cameron : I just wish my sister would put herself out there more. She has so
much to offer. Why are men so superficial?
Mitchell : That was followed by stage four... a rush of epiphanies...
Cameron : I... don't... need... food. Look at this. Architecture is everywhere.
Oh. Spaniards make amazing athletes.
Mitchell : Into stage five... despair...
Cameron : Daddy, we hided, but you didn't seek.
Mitchell : Cam?
Mitchell : Then came rage.

Cameron : Then why are you trying to push me out of your life?
Mitchell : Because you... you seem a little... Unhinged.
Cameron : Okay, well, you know what I think? You should worry a little bit
less about me and a little bit more about yourself and what you're gonna wear
tomorrow night, because I saw what you have laid out, and I don't think
you're gonna like the way you look in photos.
Mitchell : Well, I hadn't landed on that.
Haley : Her hand's in the air, like, every five seconds, and she actually
reminded Mr. Waters to assign homework. The class loved that. Do you know
how embarrassed I was?
Alex : Not as embarrassed as I was when she said 8 was a prime number. 8,
Mom.
Claire : Okay, fine. You know what? I'm gonna call the school today and have
your schedules changed, but I want you to know a little part of me died today,
okay? I thought the two of you could understand how being in the same class
would benefit you both. Alex, you... you could've tutored Haley. Haley, you
could've helped Alex with her social skills. Come on. The two of you could've
been two Super Dunphys. And instead, what are you? Two bickering halfDunphys, and I'm the fool that expected more. No, I don't even want to hear it.
Just go upstairs. Go.
Modern Family Season 3x03 page.3

Phil : Wow. What was that?

Alex : Mom. Did you call the school yet?

Claire : That was a master class in parenting. Right now our daughters are
upstairs making a decision they think is their own, but really, it was an idea
that was skillfully implanted by me.

Claire : Uh, not yet, but I was just about to.

Phil : Inception, Claire. Dangerous game, but I like it.
Claire : Mm. What are those?
Phil : Wire walkers. You want to go to the dance, you gotta wear the shoes.
Luke, grab your camera. Luke.
Luke : I wasn't sleeping.
Claire : Honey, I-I think those are... jazz shoes.
Phil : No. Tightrope shoes. Got 'em at an estate sale. Only worn once.
Claire : That... that is not a ringing endorsement for... Oh! Phil, honey. Please
be ca--careful. Right. Watch the door.
Haley : Hey, what'd you get for number 3?
Alex : You're not going to learn if I just give you answers.
Haley : Well, what if I gave you something in return?
Alex : Like what?
Haley : You can talk to me in class.
Alex : I want lunch at the cool table.
Haley : Then I want all the answers.
Alex : Then I want a week at the table.
Haley : That'll cost you two pop quizzes. month. The midterm.
Alex : Deal.
Luke : Looking great, Dad.
Phil : With these steps, I break the surly bonds... Chicken in a basket! Don't
look at me.
Alex : Mom. Mom. Mom.
Claire : What? What? What? What? What?

Phil : Uh, Bartles & Jaymes!
Alex : Good. Because we are thinking we might want to stay in that class.
Claire : Really? Oh, girls, I don't know about that.
Haley : Oh, please let us try it. Super Dunphy?
Phil : I can't hold her! I can't hold her!
Claire : Well, maybe one more week.
Haley : Thanks, Mom.
Gloria : I don't know. Uh, a cup of soup, a Cobb salad. Yeah, it had bacon.
Cam, I don't have all day to describe all my meals to you. Stop eating all my
things, you stupid animal. No, Cam, not you. I'll call you back. Bad doggy!
You want to chew on something? Okay. Okay. Okay. Look at this. Look at this
delicious man shoe. Eat it. Come on. Eat it. Eat it. Mmm! Yummy. Eat the shoe.
Eat his shoe. Come on. Eat his shoe. Num, num, num, num. Num, num. Yeah,
like this. Look. Ah. Delicious.
Manny : Mom?
Jay : Drop it.
Gloria : I...
Jay : Please. I'm sorry you had to see this.
Claire : Hello?
Rose : Hi, Mrs. Dunphy. This is Rose in the principal's office. Can you hold for
Principal Weller?
Claire : Yes.
John : Hi, Claire.
Claire : Hi, John. What'd she do this time?
John : Actually, I've got both of them in here.
Claire : Both of them? Really?
John : Alex was letting Haley copy her homework. Mr. Waters caught them.
Modern Family Season 3x03 page.4

Claire : I-I don't believe it.
John : I'm about to have a little talk with them, so they'll be out a few minutes
late.
Claire : Um, I'm so sorry, John, and honestly, I-I really am a better mother than
this. I promise.
John : So you've said.
Claire : Mm-hmm. Seriously? Seriously?? Oh. You... Excuse me. Hey, um, what
the hell is this?
Circulation agent : This zone is for loading and unloading, not for talking on
the phone.

Luke : I'm pretty sure he said "Jew." But anyway, I took the bag, and I hid it,
and I ate it all.
Phil : Oh, buddy.
Luke : I couldn't help myself. I'm weak. Don't look at me.
Phil : It's all right. It's okay. Hey, you learned a lesson. A painful lesson. I guess
we both have.
Luke : What do you mean?
Phil : I always saw myself as a guy who could soar through the sky, dancing
on a wire. I can't even get across 1/6 inches off the ground.

Claire : Yeah, I know, but I was talking on the phone to the school that my kids
were about to come out of, so...

Luke : Well, maybe that's the problem. Maybe you keep falling because part of
you knows that you can fall. Maybe if the wire was much, much higher, you
wouldn't fall.

Circulation agent : Are you aware this zone has a time limit?

Phil : Oh, Luke, Luke, Luke. You are a genius. Come on. We got work to do.

Claire : N-no, I'm not.

Luke : Yes! Can I have a doughnut first?

Circulation agent : Wow.

Phil : Yes, you can!

Claire : You know what? I do want to do some unloading. I know your type.
Life has been bad to you. It has made you feel small. And then one day
somebody gives you a fake cop outfit, a toy badge and a little spongebob tie.
Suddenly it's payback time, right? Well, I got news for you, "Law & Order:
Special Parking Unit," not my fault.
Luke : I'm really sorry, Dad.
Phil : Oh, it's all right. Everybody throws up at school. If I had a nickel for
every time I puked at school, you know how much money I'd have?

Claire : Ah, there they are, my Super Dunphys.
Haley : We're sorry, but we just...
Claire : Unh-unh-unh. You don't get to talk. You had a chance to be better
people today. You, to be more well-rounded, and you, to be a better student.
You could have elevated the Dunphy name, but instead, you chose to tarnish
it, so, congratulations, ladies, you brought this family to a new low.
Alex : Mom, are you...

Luke : 35 cents.

Claire : Yeah. Yeah, I am, and I would actually like to get these loosened up, if
I might.

Phil : Exactly. Now go get cleaned up, and I'll call the doctor.

Circulation agent : Are we gonna have any more trouble?

Luke : Wait, Dad, I don't need a doctor.

Claire : No, ma'am.

Phil : What's up?

Janet : Oh, Claire, do you need me to drive the girls?

Luke : The other day, Uncle Mitchell brought over a bag of junk food so he
and Cam could do a Jew fast.

Claire : All good, Janet. All good.

Phil : Juice fast?

Waiter : Goat cheese Risotto ball?
Cameron : No, thank you.
Modern Family Season 3x03 page.5

Waiter : Are you sure? They're so good.
Cameron : Walk away.
Mitchell : It's tough enough to deal with Cam when I'm at full strength, but I
have been fasting just as long as he has, and I do not have the energy to deal
with a big, needy brisketcase... brass... basketcase.
Mitchell : Cam! Don't be mad at me, but I think that you really need to eat
something.

Gloria : No, Manny. It's okay. I go. But I want you to know this. Where I come
from, men cherish woman. It goes wife, mistress, dog. Dog always at the
bottom.
Charlie : As you can imagine, I get asked to help, uh, with a lot of these
environmental causes. Usually, I buy a ticket, uh, bid on Shaquille O'Neal's big
shoe... And, uh, come home. But then, something happened. I love paddle
surfing, and each time I'd go out, I'd see this one sea lion. He'd pop his head
up. He'd check me out. I got so used to seeing him, I even named him...
Snorkels.

Cameron : What? You're supposed to be my support. Oh, away from me,
temptress. And I never thought I would call you that in a negative way.

Cameron : Oh, God, I do not like where this is going.

Manny : I've seen her do a lot of crazy stuff, but this is a whole new level. Is
this a people cookie?

Cameron : Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

Jay : You're good.

Charlie :So one day, I, uh, I go out and I see Snorkels. But he's doing this weird
twisting thing in the water.
Mitchell : Shh, shh.

Gloria : Are you happy? You have reduced me to a person who eats a shoe.

Charlie :So I paddle over, and I see he's got a plastic grocery bag wrapped
around his neck and one of his fins. And I freaked, tried to get it off with my
paddle. It didn't work, so I-I jumped in, but he disappeared under the water.
And, uh...

Jay : Gloria, sit.

Cameron : Don't say it. Don't you dare say it.

Gloria : You think this is funny? To talk to me like I am a dog?

Charlie :And I never saw him again.

Jay : I'm not talking to you like you're a dog. I'm just asking you to sit so we
can get to the bottom of this.

Cameron : Ohh. This is the saddest thing I've ever... Mitchell, are you okay?

Gloria : Okay, fine.
Jay : Good girl.

Cameron : Okay, well, you need to pull yourself together 'cause we're at your
boss' house.

Gloria : Come on. You set me up.

Mitchell : He drowned, Cam!

Jay : Gloria, why are you acting so crazy? It's just a little dog.

Charlie :Is he all right?

Gloria : It's not the little dog that is making me crazy. It's you that is making
me crazy.

Cameron : Yeah, yeah, I just think he needs a little air.

Jay : Me?

Cameron : Excuse me.

Gloria : Yeah, you used to put me first. You used to want me in that shower.

Mitchell : Snorkels?! Where are you, Snorkels?!

Manny : Should I be here for this?

Cameron : Mitchell, get back here!

Manny : A definitive "yes" or "no" would be appreciated. Those cupcakes did a
number on me.

Mitchell : Of course I'm not okay. None of this is okay.

Mitchell : You know who else needed air? Snorkels!

Modern Family Season 3x03 page.6

Mitchell : Oh, Snorkels!
Cameron : Mitchell, what is wrong with you?!
Mitchell : What do you think is wrong with me? I'm starving!
Cameron : Well, if you're starving, then just eat something!
Mitchell : I can't eat something because then you'll get mad at me, and we're
at my boss' house!
Cameron : I'm not gonna get mad at you! I appreciate what you're doing for
me! I'm doing it for you.
Mitchell : Oh, you don't have to do anything for me. I love you just the way
you are.
Cameron : I love you just the way you are. I got you! I got you, babe!

Claire : All week long, I'd been telling my girls how to act instead of showing
them, but not Phil. Phil could have said, Or "Haley, challenge yourself. Don't
give up so easily." But instead of talking the talk. Phil walked the walk. And
isn't that what we're supposed to do for the people we love? It's definitely a
challenge... But Phil made it look easy seven feet off the ground.
Alex : You're awesome!
Phil : Oh, my goodness!
Claire : Turns out, I've had my Super Dunphy all along.

Mitchell : Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Cameron : I got you!

Alex : Yeah!

Mitchell : Cam, I can walk. I can walk.
Cameron : I got you!
Charlie :I think Mitchell may just be a work friend.
Alex : I let down my Mom and Dad today, and... worse than that, I let down
my teacher.

Phil : What was on my mind as I was walking across that wire? I kept
thinking, if I can do this, then I've got two ways of getting across my yard.
Gloria : Did you have fun?
Lily : Yes. She's the cutest dog in the whole world.

Haley : It's all my fault. Everything I touch turns to Detention.

Gloria : Yeah, I heard you the first time.

Alex : I'm sorry, Mom.

Jay : Let's go find your daddies.

Haley : Me, too.

Mitchell : We're in here! Oh, my God. These cupcakes are so good.

Claire : Oh, I don't really have a whole lot of moral high ground to stand on. I
wasn't exactly my best self today either. All in all, not a great day for the
Dunphys.

Cameron : I'm so sorry. We helped ourselves. We were so hungry. They are
delicious.

Luke : Come on, Dad! Believe in yourself! You're making the impossible
unimpossible.

Cameron : Mmm. Mmm. They taste almost like pate. You know, I mean...

Claire : Phil. Oh, my God.

Cameron : We've been on a juice cleanse. You need to mind your own
business, sweetie, for right now.

Luke : Don't even bother. He's in the zone. He can't hear you.

Mitchell : I love that they're not too sweet, you know?
Lily : But why are you eating?

Alex : Go, Dad!
Haley : You got this!
Modern Family Season 3x03 page.7

3x04 : Door To Door
Alex : So then what happened?
Haley : Well she didn't show up to school the next day... and... I heard that she
slept over at his dorm.

Haley : Okay. Good.
[OPENING CREDITS]

Alex : No Way!

Jay : Gloria, how many times do I have to tell you to pull your car all the way
in? The gate was open all night.

Haley : Seriously, are you surprised? Do you not know Carly? Have you seen
what she wears to school?

Gloria : We live in a nice neighborhood. What are you afraid of? That some
money's gonna fly in and then your gardener is gonna have to rake it up?

Claire : Girls, lets cool it on the gossip. Okay? It's not right and Carly's got
enough problems.

Manny : Jay, I'm going to need you to cut me a check.

Haley : What do you mean?

Manny : Drama club trip. "Les Miserables." We're selling wrapping paper to
raise money for the tickets.

Claire : Well ... her mom can't get through soccer practice Without a thermos of
chardonnay... And don't get me started on the dad. That guy is...

Jay : What now?

Jay : No. No. Wait. Wait. Slow down. What's the story exactly?

Claire : Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

Manny : Well, Jean Valjean spent 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread.

Alex : Mom!

Jay : The wrapping paper.

Claire : Oh! This is such a dangerous intersection!

Gloria : 19 years for a loaf of bread? How good was this bread?

Haley : Did I get lipstick on my face?

Manny : It wasn't about the bread. It was about the society...

Alex : No, you're fine. And consider yourself lucky You didn't just get, like, felt
up by your mom.

Jay : Focus, people.

Claire : They need to get a stop sign.
Alex : What is your obsession with traffic?
Claire : It's an obsession with safety. One of these days, Joe Speeder's gonna
come tearing through here, and somebody's gonna... Aah!
Phil : I'm okay.
Claire : Oh! Oh, my god!
Phil : I'm okay. Oh, hey, guys.
Claire : Phil?
Phil : Yeah. No, I'm good. Gotta keep moving. Keep the heart rate up.
Claire : Oh. Okay.
Haley : How's my face?
Alex : Still good.

Gloria : Manny, we will buy all your wrapping paper.
Jay : No. No, we won't. No, he's got to learn to sell. This is the best business
training there is, Hell, the best life training. Manny, write this down... "A good
salesman goes after Moby Dick in a rowboat and brings the tartar sauce with
him."
Manny : Jay is always telling me to "Write this down." I don't always catch
everything he says. "Something, something, firm handshake." "Never take the
first room they show you." Not sure who "They" is. And this one just says
"Pancakes."
Mitchell : Cam, what's this scribble on the "Vanity fair" about an adoption
agency?
Cameron : Oh, uh, yeah, they called to say they wanted to reschedule our
home visit.
Modern Family Season 3x04 page.1

Mitchell : When? Why didn't you tell me? Th-this is kind of important.

Phil : We'd get, like, a million hits. This is our double rainbow!

Cameron : Well, when does it say?

Luke : We need to do it again.

Mitchell : Uh, well, who knows? It disappears into Jennifer Aniston's hair. You
gotta get a better system.

Phil : Oh, I would, buddy, but, uh, your mom's all over me to change a bunch
of lightbulbs.

Cameron : There is nothing wrong with my system. Ask me anything about
any upcoming event. I can tell you when and where it is.

Luke : How many moms does it take to screw on a lightbulb?

Mitchell : When is the adoption agency visit?

Luke : None, 'cause they get you to do it, sucker.

Phil : I don't know.

Cameron : Okay. Is that a "5" or a curl? Oh, I hope Jen's finally found love.
Mitchell : What happened here?
Cameron : Well, Lily and I woke up in a French mood, so we decided to whip
up some crepes.
Mitchell : When are you gonna be in the mood to wipe up some crepes?
Cameron : Oh, I know, it's a little messy, but... You know what? I'm gonna
clean it up.
Mitchell : Okay.
Cameron : I'll clean it up.
Mitchell : Will you?
Cameron : Just say what's on your mind.
Mitchell : You never clean up. Save the gasp. Cam, whenever you get creative
in the kitchen, I'm the one who ends up cleaning it up, okay? The homemade
pizza, fondue, molecular gastronomy. I'm still cleaning shrimp foam out of the
curtains.
Cameron : Okay, you know, Mitchell? Just go to work, okay? I'm gonna take
Lily to school, and then when I get home, I'm gonna scrub this place like a
crime scene, which it is, because you've murdered joy.

Phil : I laughed, but... It hurt a little.
Alex : We're home!
Phil : Us, too.
Claire : Oh, great. You're all here.
Phil : What's up, girl?
Claire : Oh. You know that really dangerous intersection?
Phil : Where desire meets jealousy, and the result is murder?
Claire : Mnh-mnh. The one where I almost killed you this morning.
Phil : Oh, yeah. Sorry. That was my bad. I got lost in my jams. Dangerous
combo... speed walking and speedwagon. Oh. I wasn't even trying for that.
Luke : Nice.
Claire : Well, I am getting us a stop sign. I called City Hall, and how is this for
amazing? The traffic committee meets tonight.
Alex : I've got goosebumps.
Claire : I know, right? All I have to do is get 50 signatures, show up, make my
case. It's on.

Phil : Hey, buddy. What's up?

Phil : I am so proud of you.

Luke : Hey, dad. Think fast.

Haley : We all are.

Phil : Oh, my god!

Claire : Mm.

Luke : Oh, my god!
Phil : Oh, my god!
Luke : If we had that on tape, it'd be the greatest youtube video ever!

Alex : We love when mom gets on a project because usually the minute any of
us walks in the door, she gives us something to do.
Modern Family Season 3x04 page.2

Haley : "Do your homework.

Manny : I don't know. Must've been at least three.

Alex : Clean your room."

Jay : Three? And that's your idea of the best you got?

Luke : "Put on pants."

Manny : It was very hard on me. I'm not used to rejection... Or hills.

Phil : Like the queen's coming over. Am I right? So when she's not around or
gets busy, Luke and I capitalize on the situation.

Jay : Look, you can't quit after three houses. That's... that's not perseverance.
What are you selling?
Manny : Wrapping paper.

Phil : There you are, my good man. Squire, let's do it. Get you some!

Jay : Wrong. You're selling Christmas... The excitement of opening presents,
the taste of eggnog.

Alex : Well, I think it's awesome.

Manny : I do love eggnog.

Claire : I am so glad because I could really use your help getting these
signatures.

Jay : Look, write this down... "What's the difference between 'try' and
'triumph'?"

Phil : I'll do it, soon as I change those lightbulbs you wanted.

Manny : A little oomph?

Claire : Great. Kids?

Jay : A little oomph. Get it?

Alex : Crud. You know, I've got a ton of homework.

Manny : Of course I get it. I just said it.

Luke : Uh, science project.
Claire : Haley?
Haley : I need to get started on my college essay. You know what? Maybe I'll
write it about you. You're just so inspirational. Girl power! You rock.
Claire : Thanks, honey. I do rock.

Gloria : Hey! I'm gonna kill you when I find you, silly dog! Why don't you
come back? Stella!
Cameron : I have a theory.
Gloria : Ay, Cam, thank you for helping me.
Cameron : Oh, it's my pleasure. Stella! Stella! Oh, my god.

Gloria : Stella, down. Stella, no. This is very dangerous. Okay, señorita. That's
it. Come here, because Jay is gonna be very mad if something happens to you.
Ay, tener que cuidar perro ahora. ¡Qué belleza! Go play with the bone. See you
later. Now I can cook my empanadas. The gate. Ay, no! Ay, no! The gate! The
gate! Estella, come back!

Gloria : What? Do you see her?

Jay : Hey there, Mr. Salesman.

Mitchell : You didn't clean the kitchen.

Manny : Can we not talk about business?

Cameron : Mitchell, I am an inadvertent Stanley Kowalski. How can you not
be delighted by this?

Jay : That bad, huh?
Manny : I gave it everything I got... Working the dimples, going big eyes. It
got me two things... diddly and squat.
Jay : How many houses you hit?

Cameron : No. But I see myself in the role I was born to play. Stella! Stella!
Cameron : Hello? Oh, Mitchell, you are not gonna believe this. I'm out helping
Gloria look for her dog. I'm wearing an undershirt and I'm screaming "Stella,"
just like in "Streetcar." Hello?

Mitchell : You promised.
Cameron : I was called away for an emergency. Gloria's lost her dog, and she's
heartbroken.
Modern Family Season 3x04 page.3

Gloria : Where are you, dumb dog? I hope in a big, black hole.
Mitchell : I cannot believe that you did this to me yet again. Oh.

Lily : Daddy, I'm hungry.

Cameron : I didn't do anything. I cooked a meal in our kitchen.

Mitchell : What do you want, honey?

Mitchell : And then you left on purpose, knowing that I would not be able to
sit here without cleaning it up.

Lily : Raisins.

Cameron : Life is messy sometimes. Big deal. It gets cleaned up. You're the one
with a problem if you can't leave a few dirty dishes for a couple hours.

Lily : It's too high, daddy. I can't reach.

Mitchell : O-okay, fine. C-Cam, I'm not cleaning it up.
Cameron : Great.

Mitchell : All right well, go get 'em.

Mitchell : For the record, I am not a neat freak. I-in fact, in my first long-term
relationship, I was the messy one, which is why she broke up with me. Well...

Mitchell : I mean it.
Cameron : Perfect. You know what? Why don't you make it bigger?

Man : No, thanks.

Mitchell : You know what? I will. I-I... Okay, you know, get... get ready,
because you are gonna come home to... to a giant mess.

Manny : Okay.

Cameron : And I will give him a giant hug when I get there. Stella!

Jay : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me show you how it's done. Hi. Uh, Jay
Pritchett here. Holidays are just around the corner.
Man : I'm sorry. I don't believe in wrapping paper.

Luke : Hey, dad. Think fast.
Phil : Oh. Wow. Buddy. I'm sorry. I told you, I gotta change the lightbulbs and
then help your mom with those signatures.
Luke : Never mind. I guess it was a stupid idea anyways.

Jay : What do you mean you don't believe in wrapping paper? It's not Bigfoot.
It exists.
Man : It's not eco-friendly. It's wasteful.
Jay : No, not this stuff. This paper was made from 100% recycled materials.
Manny : I don't think so.

Phil : I've always said that if my son thinks of me as one of his idiot friends,
then I've succeeded as a dad. If he wants to go the wrong way on the escalator,
I'm on board. If he wants to go into a restaurant and pretend we're Australian,
toss a few shrimp on the Barbie for me and my Joey. Yeah? Right? Nicole
Kidman? Men at work?

Old Man : I can't understand what you're saying.
Gloria : She's an ugly little fresh bulldog with the tiny ears and the smushy
face. What is so hard to understand?
Cameron : Maybe I should translate.

Phil : Here we go. Take 12. Hey, buddy! I'm home!
Luke : Hey, dad. Think fast. Wow. You know, my arm's starting to hurt a little.
Phil : Really? 'Cause my face feels great.
Luke : Come on, dad. Let's not turn on each other. We could be here a while.
Phil : Yeah. Okay. You're right. Here we go. Take nine.

Weird man : I really don't like people coming to my door unannounced while
I'm working on my carving.
Claire : I understand, but a stop sign is really important. What exactly are you
carving?

Luke : You're not even trying.
Modern Family Season 3x04 page.4

Manny : Hello, ma'am. Do you love christmas?
Woman : Actually, I'm jewish.

Phil : Okay. Huddle up, everybody. Your mother's right. She's the quarterback
of this family, and we need to protect her like blind side did.

Manny : Oh, well, then you must appreciate a good value.

Luke : She just said the mom was blind side.

Jay : Oh, jeez.

Phil : Well, she's confused. Blind side was the black kid who played tight end.
Alex : Offense line.

Cameron : If you see her, let us know.

Phil : Sorry. African-american kid.

Claire : Oh, my god. No, no. No, no. Are you kidding? Seriously?!

Gloria : There she is. Ay! Stella! Ay, thank god you found my dog. Thank you.
Blanche : This is my dog. Her name's Pinky.

Luke : See? You're not keeping your head in the right position.

Gloria : No, it's not. Her name is Stella. It says right here on the tag. Look.

Phil : I know that's me, but I'm not remembering any of this.

Cameron : Uh, uh, uh, excuse me. Hi, sweetie. What's your name?

Claire : Oh. Those stupid neighbors!

Blanche : Blanche.

Phil : What's wrong?

Cameron : Shut up. Mitchell would die. Listen, we don't know you. You seem
like a very sweet little girl, and right now we're forced to... I can't believe I'm
saying this to you... rely on the kindness of strangers.

Claire : I can't ask for a simple signature, but it's fine for them to build a house
that looks like the Beverly Hillbillies just moved in. Did you do any better?
Phil : We came close a few times, but you're not talking about the basketball,
are you?
Claire : Phil, tell me you got some signatures. I have to be at City Hall in, like,
two hours. Oh, god. Haley, how about you?

Blanche : I'll sell her to you for $200.
Gloria : That's it. Give me my dog.
Blanche : Aah!

Haley : I've been busy with my college essay.

Gloria : Oh, really? The little girl thinks because she can scream, she can get
away with everything? I can scream, too. Aah!

Claire : Really? Where is it?

Blanche : Aah!

Haley : It's in a rough, rough draft right now. I've been thinking that maybe
that I should... Alex has been skyping with her boyfriend since you left.

Cameron : Aah!

Alex : That's so not true!

Jay : What the hell sound is that?

Claire : Thank you. Really, thank all of you so much for your help. Really?

Manny : Coyotes must've got a cat. Jay, can we stop now? I'm getting hungry.

Phil : Sometimes those things need to warm up, like the car.

Jay : You know what the problem is? You're not hungry.

Claire : Phil, don't even. I have been out there, trying to do something good
for our community, because let me tell you, change doesn't just happen. It is
forged by empowered women like me and Norma Rae and the lady from "The
Blind Side." Do you know what the difference is between me and her? Blind
side's family had her back.

Manny : I had a carrot at 3:00.
Jay : What if you couldn't feed your family unless you made this next sale?
What if you were gonna lose your house?

Modern Family Season 3x04 page.5

Jay : I know I was pushing the kid hard, but here's the thing... I'm an older
dad. I'm not gonna be around forever. And I'll sleep better knowing he's got
something to fall back on.

Head of Committee : Uh, yeah, it's fine. Uh, just... if you could make it quick.
We... it's an ice cream cake.
Claire : Okay.
Man : A-actually, it's not.

Jay : Come on! Let's hit another one.

Head of Committee : What?

Manny : I can't do it.

Man : No.

Jay : What?

Head of Committee : Really? Oh, then we... we're not in a rush, I guess. At all.
No rush. Go ahead.

Manny : I don't have what it takes.
Jay : What kind of talk is that?
Manny : It's the truth, Jay. I'm not a great salesman. I'm not a great
businessman. I'm not you. Do you know what it's like to see all the amazing
things you've accomplished, knowing I never will? How am I supposed to live
up to you? How is anyone?
Jay : Ah, so the fish weren't biting today. So what? That's life. You tried hard,
and that's what matters.
Manny : Yeah.
Jay : You know, I-I actually need some wrapping paper. You know where I can
find some?
Manny : You don't have to do that.
Jay : I want to do it.
Manny : You'll never go broke playing to a rich guy's ego... Write that down.
Head of Committee : Thanks so much, you guys.
Man : Maybe you should make a wish.
Claire : Uh, hi. Oh, sorry. Um, I'm here for the traffic committee meeting?
Man : The meeting's been adjourned.
Claire : Yeah. Um...
Head of Committee : It's my birthday.
Claire : I'm sorry. Happy birthday. Uh, just... someone sent me to the wrong
room, and you guys don't meet again for months, and this is pretty much a
matter of life and death, so...

Claire : Great. My name is Claire Dunphy, and my family and I live near that
intersection of...
Head of Committee : Why not? Why not?
Man : The freezer was broken, and we couldn't keep it here.
Head of Committee : See? This is why I ask you to think ahead, okay? Do you
have your 50 signatures?
Claire : Uh, almost. I have 34, but I...
Head of Committee : Oh. That's the same thing.
Claire : Wow. I'm confused.
Head of Committee : It's not the same thing. No. No. 34 is not the same thing
as 50, just like a cake is not the same thing as an ice cream cake.
Claire : Right. I get that. Sir, I'm trying to save lives here...
Haley : Mom.
Head of Committee : And I can get you the rest of the signatures.
Haley : Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom! Oh, my god.
Claire : What are you doing here? Girls.
Alex : We... we went door to door and we got you 20 more signatures.
Claire : That is so sweet of you.
Haley : Well, you were freaking out at us, so...
Claire : Okay, you know, let's not ruin it. All right, 54 signatures. Okay. So
what do you say? Let's start saving lives one intersection at a time.
Head of Committee : Okay, thank you very much. We will, uh, take these
under advisement. Just leave 'em here, and thank you...
Modern Family Season 3x04 page.6

Phil : Wait a minute. I know what that means.
Head of Committee : Oh, here we go.

Phil : Allow me. Allow me. Ladies and gentlemen, I've lived with this woman
for 20 years. If she wants a stop sign... there's gonna be a stop sign.

Phil : That's Washington-speak for "Get lost."

Haley : He's right.

Claire : Well, um, wow, Phil. What are you doing here?

Alex : Listen to the man.

Phil : I'm your husband. I'm blindsiding you.

Luke : Yeah.

Claire : Uh...

Man : Still... no good? No bueno?

Phil : Your honor, permission to approach.
Claire : Not a judge.

Cameron : I'm home!

Head of Committee : I'll allow it.

Mitchell : Oh, hey. Did you find Stella?

Phil : I'll get straight to the point because this is important, and that appears to
be an ice cream cake.

Cameron : Safe and sound.

Head of Committee : Well, it's not!

Cameron : Oh! Hey!

Phil : Okay. I present to you "Stop in the name of life." Kick it.

Mitchell : I did it! I left the mess. Aren't you proud of me?

Mitchell : Mm.

Cameron : I sure am. Good for you!
Phil : Clive Bixby. Can I meet you at Harry's bar in two minutes? Baby, I can
do anything in two minutes. I'll just speed through the intersection of
Greenleaf and Bristol. It's easy 'cause there's no stop sign.

Mitchell : You know, it wasn't easy at first, but I just... I took Lily to the park,
and I completely put it out of my mind. And I think I really cleared a hurdle
today.

Luke : I love being a kid. I have my whole life ahead of me.
Phil : No!

Cameron : Oh, that's great. I'm super proud of you, And you're... and you're
not even tempted to clean it up now?

Luke : No!

Mitchell : No!
Cameron : That's great.

Claire : Okay. Well...

Mitchell : No, not now that you're home.

Phil : Powerful.

Cameron : So guess I'd better get started.

Claire : And unconventional, but I believe it makes our point. So what do you
say?

Mitchell : Yeah.

Head of Committee : Well, the kid was all right. I didn't care for you so much.
But if I were to give a stop sign to everybody who wanted a stop sign... This
city would grind to a halt.

Mitchell : Oh, my god.

Claire : I understand, sir, but...
Head of Committee : Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you.

Cameron : I don't like it. It's so gross.
Cameron : What?
Mitchell : I was right. You wanted me to clean it up.
Cameron : Oh, that's preposterous. I will not stand here and take this from
you.

Mitchell : Oh, Cam! "Life is messy. I love chaos." You are so full of it. Well, you
know what? That's all right. No worries. Hey, come on. Come on, just embrace
it. It's life.

Phil : You know what, Lukey? My dad was away a lot. And I'm not gonna do
that to you. I'm gonna be the kind of dad... How many more of these do you
wanna do?

Cameron : Oh, no§ Oh! Okay, now that is gratuitous.
Mitchell : Oh, it's okay.
Cameron : No! That's Lily's favorite cereal. This is ridiculous.
Mitchell : Relax! Hey, Lily! Honey, come here! Sweetheart, do you want a
princess hat?
Lily : Yes! Yes! Yes!
Mitchell : Okay.
Cameron : Oh. Oh, okay. That... that is enough! No! You've proven your point.
I don't like to clean up. It's smelly, it's sticky, and after I eat, I'm tired, and I just
want to lay down.
Mitchell : And you put it off, knowing that I would do it?
Cameron : Yes! Are you happy?
Mitchell : Yes... I... Am.
Ellen : Hi. I'm Ellen Roberts from the adoption agency. I'm... Here for the
home visit.
Mitchell : Oh!
Cameron : I might need to tweak my system.
Luke : Hey, dad. Think fast.
Phil : Sacagawea! Wait, wait, wait... I need a break. Oh! John Philip Sousa! Oh,
my...
Luke : 78 views.
Phil : We are on our way.
Luke : Yeah, we are.

3x05 : Hit And Run

Cameron : Sylvester Stallone. I said it first. Oh, my God. This guy brought his
kids, Mitchell.

Duane : Hey, sir. Duane Bailey, running for, uh, town council reelection.

Mitchell : What, to this movie? Isn't it supposed to be super violent?

Claire : Oh, don't look. There's that jerk Duane Bailey.

Cameron : I'm sorry. I don't mean to overstep, but I don't know that this movie
is really appropriate for children. I'm terrified to see it. That's why we're here
during the day.

Phil : Oh, yuck.
Claire : I should say something to him, shouldn't I?
Phil : I gotta be honest, I was just working off your tone. Who's Duane Bailey,
and why do we hate him?
Claire : Honey, he's that councilman who shot down my stop sign. Big phony.
Phil : Yeah.
Duane : Hey! Duane Bailey, seeking reelection, town council. Hope that I can
count on your vote.
Phil : Well, you just got it.
Claire : No. You don't remember meeting me, do you? Claire Dunphy. Last
month's town council meeting?
Duane : Oh, yes I do! Yes, I remember you. I want a stop sign. Just having fun.
Here, have a pen.
Claire : "Duane Bailey. Councilman. Citizen. Puggle breeder."
Duane : I love them because they're a different mix of breeds, just like
America.

Man : It's okay. We're good.
Cameron : Okay. I tried.
Mitchell : Yeah. All you can do.
Cameron : You know, I've... I've read this book, and I know what's gonna
happen, and it's very disturbing. I really think you might be inviting some
pretty serious nightmares here.
Man : Hey, buddy, they're my kids. I got it.
Cameron : Yeah, but I don't think you do.
Mitchell : Cam. Cam. He says he's got it, all right? You said your piece. Just
watch the movie.
Cameron : Oh, uh,
Mitchell : Gwyneth Paltrow.
Cameron : I really must insist you not traumatize your kids...
Mitchell : Cam.

Phil : I like what he's saying, Claire.

Cameron : ...by exposing them to gratuitous violence...

Claire : He isn't saying anything.

Mitchell : Stop it. Shh!

Phil : Look at his...

Cameron : ...and graphic depictions of...

Claire : We need a stop sign at our intersection.

Girl : Daddy, I'm scared.

Duane : Everyone says that, but pretty soon, we're stopping at every single
corner. Why don't you go ask Canada how that's working out?

Cameron : Yeah, well, you're gonna be. I'm gonna tell you one more time.

Phil : He nailed it.

Mitchell : Okay.

Man : No, I'm gonna tell you one more time.

Duane : Hi. Duane Bailey. Hi.
Mitchell : It was "The muppet" movie. We were in the wrong theater.
Cameron : "Actor/writer/director who packs a punch."
Mitchell : Oh, Sylvester Stallone.

Cameron : Enjoy the show. I was always a fan of the muppets, especially the
two guys in the theater who wouldn't shut up.

Man : Just leave.

Gloria : Do you want to send a message or not?

[OPENING CREDITS]

Gloria : Jay never wants me to help him with his business, and now suddenly,
Manny doesn't want to listen to me either. It's very frustrating. I have all the
answers.

Gloria : Hello?
Jay : I'm running late. This knucklehead's kept me waiting for over an hour. I
never had to wait like this when his dad was running things.
Gloria : Yeah. And soda was a nickel. Just tell them that your family is coming
over.
Jay : This guy fired his own father. He's not gonna care about my family.
Gloria : Okay, then just leave. You don't need his money.
Jay : Once a week, I have eight family members coming to my house for free
food. I'm not going anywhere.
Gloria : Okay. I see you when I see you. Are you okay? What is wrong?
Manny : I want to be homeschooled.
Gloria : Really, Manny? Do you want me to learn you English? What is going
on?
Manny : I have a big report due, and the teachers don't seem to care about the
substance. All they care about is the flash.
Gloria : Manny, sometimes you can be a little bit old-fashioned. Remember the
first time you saw the kids with the backpacks with wheels and you thought
they were too flashy?
Manny : You're going to school, not boarding a flight to Denver. It's getting
absurd. Reuben freestyle-rapped his report on Irish immigrants. That doesn't
even make sense. Maybe you do a Riverdance. Maybe.
Gloria : What is your report on?
Manny : The mafia.
Gloria : Perfect. We do a papier-mache Tommy gun.
Manny : Oh, no. We shouldn't have to jazz it up.
Gloria : Okay, then we go upstairs and we get your old rocking horse and we
chop the head off.
Manny : No, that's a terrible idea. I love Brownie!

Josh : Hey! There he is. Bring it in, Jay.
Jay : How you doing, Joshie?
Josh : It's Josh now. Have a seat. Ah, all right. So I flipped through your
proposal, and here's the thing... We're about to build our largest luxury condo
complex yet. And I have an important question for you... What is it you want
to build?
Jay : Closets.
Josh : See, I was kinda hoping you'd say "dreams."
Jay : I thought that was implied.
Josh : Jay, I'm looking for closets nobody's ever seen before, you know, a big
"wow!" You know what I'm saying?
Jay : You want a nice closet with sharp design, quality materials, and expert
craftsmanship.
Josh : Uh, I mean, I want it to be like, bam! You know, people are gonna walk
in there and go, "whoa! What do I hang first?"
Jay : I wanted to hang myself.
Jay : Yeah, let's talk more specific. What exactly do you like and what don't
you like?
Josh : All right, fair enough. Uh... I don't like this. This makes me sad. I do like
getting my mind blown.
Jay : I love your enthusiasm. Uh, before I go off in the wrong direction, how
about an example?
Josh : All right, check this out. So, like, three weeks ago, I'm down in South
Beach. I walk into this thumpin' club. Bartender says, "what do you wanna
drink?" I say, "wow me." He mixes this thing together. I take one sip, and I'm

That's what I want in a closet.

Phil : I wanna be the one to push you off the cliff.

Jay : I don't think I need to hear any more.

Phil : Great. Go fly.

Claire : I think I'm gonna do it.
Claire : Phil.

Haley : Whatcha doing there? Homework?

Phil : No.

Alex : What do you want?

Claire : Oh, Phil!

Haley : I need to borrow some money. It's really important.
Alex : How much?
Haley : $900.

Phil : I'll admit it. I'm turned on by powerful women... Michelle Obama,
Oprah, Condoleezza Rice,

Alex : What?!
Haley : Come on. If you were in trouble, I would do anything for you. We're
not just sisters. We're best friends.
Alex : Look, I would if I could, but I don't have any money. And since we're
talking, I never told anyone this before, and it...

Cameron : Do you want a fry?
Mitchell : No, I can't eat. We should've stayed and seen "The muppets." I can't
even look at ketchup without seeing blood.
Cameron : Ooh, runaway curly fry. You know these are good luck. Mm!

Claire : ...Wipe that smug smile off his stupid face.

Mitchell : Oh!

Phil : His face is stupid.

Cameron : Oh, my God. What was that?

Claire : Oh! I can't believe ridiculous people like him end up in office.

Mitchell : We just got rear-ended.

Phil : Well, why don't you run? You're smart, you care about the community,
and you're easy on the eyes when you put a little effort into it.

Cameron : Oh, pull off to the side street. Pull off to the side street.

Claire : Are you serious?
Phil : Yeah, you know, maybe change out of the sweaty gym clothes every
once in while. I thought you were talking about running for office. Go on.
Claire : I'd be lying if I said I'd never thought about it. I mean, I know it's a
ridiculous little local thing, but it might be fun to get out there and contribute.
Plus I think I'd be good at it.

Mitchell : Are you okay?
Cameron : Oh, I think I cut the roof of my mouth on the straw. Oh, my God.
Mitchell : Mm!
Cameron : So yes.
Driver : Oh, boy. I am so sorry. This is all my fault. Are you guys okay?
Cameron : W-well, I-I sustained a minor mouth injury.

Phil : You'd be great.

Mitchell : We're fine. Thank you. It's...

Claire : Mm. How would this work? I mean, who would be here for the kids
after school? Who would take them to practice and recitals and keep them
from burning the house down?

Driver : Look, I feel terrible. Um, don't worry. I'm gonna take care of
everything. Let me just get my insurance info.

Phil : It must be so hard being a single mom. Claire, I will. If you wanna fly,
I'm not gonna hold your feet to the ground.

Cameron : Well, he seems nice.

Claire : Hmm.

Mitchell : Okay. Thank you.
Mitchell : Yeah.

Modern Family Season 3x05 page.3

Cameron : You know, if this were a romantic comedy, this would be our meet
cute. We'd spend the rest of the afternoon drinking wine, eating food, flying a
kite, you know, doing montage-y stuff.

Luke : It's in a block of ice. I got the idea when I heard about rich guys with
frozen assets. Assets.

Mitchell : Yeah, am I in this movie of yours?
Cameron : Yeah, you're the gay best friend.
Mitchell : Oh, my God!

Claire : I am running for town council, and I understand that I can pick up a
form here.

Cameron : Oh, my God! We have a runner!

Secretary : Fourth floor. Elevator down the hall.

Mitchell : Um, it's D-W-Y... I can't read it.

Duane : Oh. Beyonce, when'd you start working here?

Cameron : Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

Secretary : Oh, Duane. He's always saying stuff like that.

Mitchell : Go where?

Duane : Duane Bailey. Running for reelection.

Cameron : We have to chase him down!

Claire : You're joking. I just saw you in the parking lot two hours ago.

Mitchell : No, we're not supposed to do that!

Duane : Oh, hey. It's you! Oh, it's you. What... are you doing here?

Cameron : Help! Stop that car! He's getting away! Help!

Claire : I am entering the race for town council, and I am running against you.

Mitchell : Yeah, you almost got him, Cam. You almost got him.

Duane : Oh. Well, don't you have pluck.

Cameron : He's getting away!

Claire : No, I plan on winning, so...

Haley : Hey. Whatcha doing? Playing?

Duane : Oh, yeah, I bet you do. Marcia! Rocking the bangs! Love it. Do you
know why, of all the dogs in the world, I breed puggles?

Luke : Yeah.

Claire : Why do I feel like this is a rhetorical question, and you're about to l...

Haley : Do you have any money saved up?

Duane : It's because they're lovable, yes, but they're also tenacious hunters
who won't quit until the kill is complete.

Luke : I'm comfortable.

Claire : Really? 'Cause I feel like they just yip a lot.

Luke : I've saved $1,217. It wasn't even that hard.

Duane : Look, lady, you're going down. I've won six straight elections. I don't
plan on losing to some bored housewife, so don't quit your lack of a day job.

Claire : Don't forget your lunch.

Claire : Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me. Hello? Anne. Haley did that? Oh,
God. Okay. Um... I'll call you right back. For your information, sir, I am no
bored housewife. No, I-I would kill for "bored." Why isn't this lighting up?

Luke : Thanks, mom.
Claire : Don't forget your lunch money, buddy.
Luke : Thanks, dad.

Duane : Oh, it's because it's, uh, staff only. Yeah. Here. Allow me to... not get
that for you. Good luck!

Phil : You bet.
Luke : Dad, I cut my arm.
Haley : Please. It's really important.

Phil : Oh, wow. You sure did, buddy. I'll get you fixed up.

Luke : Look, I'd love to help you out, but I'm not very liquid right now.

Luke : Where's mom?
Modern Family Season 3x05 page.4

Phil : She belongs to the people now.

Manny : I'm finding there's less and less we can talk about.

Alex : My allergies are acting up again.

Gloria : So why didn't you tell him that you've been in the business for such a
long time...

Phil : Well, it is your lucky day, because, missy, Dr. Dad has everything you
need. Behold the healing powers of grape flavoring.
Alex : Where's mom?

Jay : It's not gonna make any difference. He wants to make a change. And I got
a factory full of people depending on this.

Luke : Some people took her.

Gloria : Yeah, but maybe if you tell him that...

Phil : Drink this. Listen, guys, your mom is taking on more responsibilities
outside of the... house, but don't you worry. Good old... dad... Oh, my
goodness!

Jay : Gloria, please. I-I-I've had a tough day. Can we please not talk about it?

Luke : Ow!

Gloria : I do!

Phil : I'm so sorry!

Jay : Hey, guys.

Luke : You punched me!

Haley : Hey, grandpa.

Alex : Dad, you gave me the drowsy kind.

Alex : Hey, Jay.

Phil : There's a drowsy kind?!

Jay : What's with her?

Alex : I have to study for a test!

Phil : Just tired. Growth spurt.

Luke : Oh! It really hurts!

Cameron : Hey, hey.

Phil : Well, I'll get you some ice.

Jay : Hi, guys. Hi, baby girl.

Luke : No. No, no, no. I'll get it.

Gloria : Hola, Lily. How are you?

Gloria : But I want to help.
Jay : Trust me. I wish you had the answers.

Lily : Dads are fighting.
Gloria : Oh, you made it. How was it?

Cameron : No, uh, we're not fighting.

Jay : Eh.

Mitchell : No, not at all, honey. No. Okay, uh, go play, sweetheart. Okay?

Gloria : Why? What's wrong, babe?

Cameron : Let's go play with some blocks. Let's go stack some blocks.

Jay : I don't want to talk about it.

Mitchell : All right. Okay, the reason we're fighting is 'cause this one thinks
he's dirty Harry.

Gloria : Do it anyways.
Jay : Uh, this stupid kid's been in the business about ten minutes. He barely
looks at my proposal, and he says he wants more "wow."

Jay : Having a hard time picturing Clint Eastwood in that shirt.

Gloria : What does he mean by more "wow"?

Cameron : Okay, let me ask you something. Today, at a stoplight, a guy ran
into our car, and then just took off. I wanted to chase after him. Mitchell...

Manny : It's the "Bieber-ization" of America.

Mitchell : Kept a level head and called the police.

Jay : What do beavers have to do with anything?

Luke : Pfft. Police. Aren't they too busy winning the war on drugs?

Gloria : The beavers... they build the dams all over the country so there's no
floods, is the "beaver-ization" of the Americas.

Mitchell : Okay, so which one of us did the right thing?
Jay : Hit and run. Gotta chase him down.
Modern Family Season 3x05 page.5

Gloria : I chase the people all the time.

Luke : Dad hit me.

Mitchell : No. No. That's... that's irresponsible and dangerous. Okay, well,
what if he had been armed?

Phil : It was an accident. I was trying to open up a band-aid!

Cameron : He wasn't armed. He had a Hillary bumper sticker.

Phil : Growth spurt.

Mitchell : This isn't an isolated incident. This morning he flipped out at
somebody at The Muppet movie.

Claire : What's wrong with her?

Lily : You saw The Muppet movie without me?
Mitchell : Oh, no. No, honey. Just the first two numbers. No, Lily. Wait.
Claire : Hi. Hi. Hi. Phil, where are you, honey? I need to talk to you. Do you
know what our daughter did?
Phil : Nothing. She's fine. She's reading.
Claire : No, not her. Haley. Haley! Come over here. I want to talk to you.
Phil : There she is. Not a scratch on her.
Claire : Do you have something you want to say to us?
Haley : Uh...
Claire : Mmm... let me help you out here. Fake I.D.s?
Phil : What?!
Claire : Mm-hmm. Haley tried to get her and her friends some fake I.D.s.
Haley : I wasn't gonna use them for drinking. We just wanted to get into this
club to see a band.
Claire : She took a bunch of money from them and then she lost it.

Claire : Phil! What's wrong with her?

Phil : I drugged her.
Claire : Phil!
Phil : I accidentally gave her the nighttime allergy medicine.
Claire : Mm. All right, one thing at a time. Haley, how are you going to repay
your friends?
Haley : I don't know.
Gloria : I know. You go there with a couple of guys...
Jay : She's gotta get the money back. Who is this kid?
Haley : A guy at school's cousin's friend. He lives in Gardena.
Mitchell : Well, if you know where he lives, just call the police.
Phil : No cops. We can't afford a scandal right now. Claire's running for town
council.
Claire : That was before, when I thought you could take care of the children. I
take my eye off the ball for one minute, and I've got one in a coma, one with a
black eye, and one running a crime ring.

Phil : How much?

Gloria : Well, to be fair, Haley started her crime ring when your eye was still
on the ball.

Alex : $900.

Haley : It's not a crime ring. I just gotta get my hands on that $900.

Phil : You're kidding me!

Manny : I know how the mafia would handle this.

Claire : Oh, my God! Oh!

Jay : The kid is right. I'm sick of these smart-ass punks who keep changing the
rules and think they can get away with anything they want. I'm gonna pay this
guy a visit. Haley, text me his address.

Haley : It's not my fault! I gave money to this guy. He's the one who ripped us
off.
Claire : What happened to your face?
Luke : Oh. I ran into a door.
Phil : Yeah.
Claire : What happened to your face?

Phil : I'm going with you.
Cameron : Me, too.
Mitchell : Oh, no. No. Nobody's going anywhere. Okay, we're not vigilantes.
Cameron : Shotgun!
Modern Family Season 3x05 page.6

Mitchell : No! No weapons!

Claire : This guy has won six elections. I am way out of my league.

Gloria : In my country, it is tradition... when the men are out seeking
vengeance, the women... they stay home, and they drink.

Gloria : Look, I don't know anything about this guy, but I know that you're a
tough lady, and I come from a family of tough ladies. And I have to say,
sometimes you scare me a little bit. And I know that you're strong enough to
win and definitely strong enough to be okay if you lose.

Claire : Sometimes I think you just make this stuff up.
Gloria : Do you want a drink or not?
Claire : Oh, yeah.
Gloria : So what happened? You were running for office, and now you're not?
Claire : Mm. I don't really want to talk about that.
Gloria : I know. I am sick and tired of no one needing my help. You are going
to tell me what is wrong, and I'm gonna give you the right answer, because I
have all of them. So why are you not running for office?
Claire : Because my family needs me too much. You saw what just happened.
Gloria : Why are you not running for office?
Claire : That doesn't work on me.
Gloria : Why are you not running for office?!
Claire : Because I don't want to lose! I... pfft! I haven't done anything outside
of my house in 18 years. I don't want the first thing that I do to be a complete
failure.

Claire : I scare you?
Gloria : Are you kidding me? "I want Thanksgiving at my house!"
Claire : Why does everybody think I talk like that?
Jay : This is it.
Mitchell : W-w-wait. No, no. Come on. Do we have a plan? It doesn't seem
like we have a plan.
Phil : Yeah, I got a plan. Either he gives us the money, or he gets a private
performance from england Dan and John Ford Coley.
Mitchell : That's not a good plan. That's not even a good band.
Jay : If all you're gonna do is criticize, just wait by the car.
Mitchell : Okay, fine. I'll see you in jail. It's gonna be a big adjustment for two
of you.
Jay : Ugh.

Gloria : Okay. I'm gonna tell you a story about a little girl who entered a
beauty pageant... Even though she was very, very scared that she was going to
lose.

Peter : Yeah?

Claire : Let me guess. You won.

Jay : You know Haley Dunphy? You owe her $900. We're here to collect.

Gloria : Of course I won, but I was talking about my cousin Maria Conchita.
She had a nose like a toucan, she stuffed her body in this bikini, and at the end,
she finished dead last.

Phil : You dig?

Claire : How is that a good story?
Gloria : Because she faced her fears, and it didn't kill her.
Claire : Hmm.

Jay : You Peter?
Peter : What do you want?

Peter : I tried to call that girl, like, ten times, but her voice mail was always...
full.
Phil : That does sound like Haley.
Cameron : So how are you gonna make this right?

Gloria : What killed her two weeks later was a bus.

Peter : You guys want the money, right? That's fine. I don't need any hassle.
Hold on. I'll just... grab it.

Claire : Are you serious?

Jay : That was easy.

Gloria : Yes, because she couldn't see anything coming with that big nose.
Modern Family Season 3x05 page.7

Phil : He's lucky he didn't put up a fight. I would've treated him to a reunion
of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young!

Jay : Hmm.

Cameron : We got a runner! Runner!

Luke : Heard it.

Phil : Asset.

Mitchell : Stop! Stop! Stop! No. No. No. No. Oh! I got him!
Cameron : Oh, my God. You did!
Mitchell : Don't be so surprised. Help! He's slipping out of his skinny jeans.
These are cute. I totally have these.

Gloria : And look at the shelves over here. They're for the shoes. Those are my
favorite ones. So what do you think?
Josh : Wow!

Jay : Hmm?
Phil : Ha ha ha!

Jay : Same... exact... closet.

Jay : There you go!
Haley : Oh, you got it back! Thank you!
Jay : Hey, don't thank me. Thank your uncle Mitchell. He's the one who
tackled the guy.
Mitchell : I got grass stains.

Cameron : We never needed fake I.D.s on the farm. We figured if a 16-year-old
could drive a tractor, he could drink a beer. Not at the same time, of course. It's
Missouri, not Texas.

Haley : Well, I will tell you one thing. I have learned my lesson. Disappointing
my family and friends is punishment enough.

Mitchell : I used a fake I.D. to get into an "R"-rated movie... "the fabulous
Baker boys." I found the title to be misleading. Lot of Michelle Pfeiffer... that's
all I'm saying.

Phil : Nice try. You're grounded for two weeks.

Jay : I remember when I got my fake I.D.

Gloria : Okay, we have big news. Claire has decided to run for mayor after all.

Phil : Me, too. Crazy times.

Claire : Thank you, but it's town council.

Jay : Hell, yeah. I tried to enlist in the army, but they saw right through me, so
me and a bunch of guys drove across state lines, we got a bunch of booze, we
loaded up on fireworks, and I woke up in the morning... I kid you not... in a
Mexican strip joint. You?

Gloria : It doesn't matter. You're not going to win anyways. But she's going to
be okay. You see? I help the people. Why don't you two let me help you?
Manny : Well, I can't speak for Jay, but I guess I'm just too proud to ask for
help.
Jay : Are you serious? She cuts your steak.

Phil : Uh, I used mine to rent some bowling shoes and kept 'em. Suckers
probably spent months trying to track down Dr. Richard Hertz. Think about it.

Gloria : What about you?
Jay : I don't want to bother you with my business.
Gloria : What else do I do every day?
Jay : I don't know. I'm guessing the gym and... one other thing?
Claire : Dad, you should listen to her. She might really help you.
Jay : Huh.
Claire : She could be an asset.

them I even spent studying. Don't tell your mom.
Haley : And maybe don't tell me.

Phil : She's... she's loving it. She's loving it. I showed her the student union. We
visited the dorms. We sat in on a class. I really think she's starting to see what
college has to offer. Oh, hang on, Claire. Go, bulldogs!
[OPENING CREDITS]

Phil : College!
Haley : He was shielding his eyes from the sun.
Phil : Knew it when I hit it.
Claire : Phil is taking Haley to visit his Alma Mater.
Phil : Loved college.
Claire : Mm, we were hoping some of that enthusiasm rubs off on her. Go,
bullfrogs!
Phil : Dogs. Bulldogs. I feel like you do that on purpose.
Claire : No, it's just... I say "bull, " and I can't remember if it's frogs or dogs.
Phil : When I talk to my old friends from college, do we croak or do we bark?
Phil : I got it. Hello?
Phil : No way! Haley, no way! Check it out! After a few beers, my buds and I
would jump on these lunch trays and race down this same hill. Hop on.
Haley : I don't want to to hop on.
Phil : Seriously, you'll get the giggles.
Haley : I don't want the giggles.
Phil : Hey, honey.
Claire : How's the trip going?
Phil : So good.
Claire : Go, bullfrogs.
Phil : It's dogs.
Claire : Oh, sorry. How's Haley doing?

Gloria : Manny, who is this Bella girl, and why is her name all over your
notebook?
Manny : Bella's no girl, mom. She has recently blossomed, like a purple lilac in
April.
Gloria : What do you mean, she blossom? Like, the poo-berty?
Manny : Yeah. I'll get it.
Jay : Hey, Gloria, your show's about to start.
Gloria : Record it.
Jay : No, the DVR's filling up. Let's just watch and get it over with.
Jay : Gloria's always saying we should do more stuff together. So I agreed to
watch this crazy Colombian soap opera she loves.
Gloria : "Fuego y hielo."
Jay : Which apparently, is Spanish for "big hair and yelling."
Gloria : "Fire and ice." It's about human suffering. I relate to it.
Jay : I'm just saying, the guy's a judge. He can put a shirt on.
Gloria : Ay, what is that?
Manny : Oh, nothing.
Gloria : That doesn't look like a nothing. What is inside?
Manny : Oh, it's just something I bought. I'm gonna go open it in my room.
Gloria : I don't like this. Manny has never kept a secret from me.
Jay : Don't worry about it.
Gloria : What do you think it could be?
Jay : Well, right now I'm a little worried it could be the rest of my evening.
Modern Family Season 3x06 page.1

Mitchell : Uh, hey, Joanne? Two number nines to go.
Claire : Mwah! Bye-bye. Love you.
Holly : Hey, Claire, listen. Uh, if you want, some of the moms are gonna stay
and watch "Gone with the wind" in my new screening room. I got Pinot!

Phil : Was I wrong? Are these not the best wings you've ever had in your life?

Claire : I would love to, but I'm not feeling that great, so I'm probably just
gonna go home and rest. Plus I've seen that movie.

Phil : And you didn't wanna get 40. Oh, and by the way, this is just the start of
your evening. Next up, it's over to the quad for a musical interlude from
tenors, anyone? It's an all-male singing group...

Claire : No, I never saw "Gone with the wind," but I have two kids at
sleepovers, and Haley's out of town with Phil. That means I have one night to
myself, which happens once every never. I am not spending it with some
gossipy mom who was mean to me in High School. I need a fun night out.

Haley : Got it.

Claire : What the hell is this? No. I asked you guys for a fun night out, not this.
I-I-I need music and dancing and secondhand smoke.
Cameron : Oh, please give this place a chance. It's a great value. The room is so
cozy, and the potpies are to die for.
Claire : Are you really comfortable with what you just said? Come on. What
happened to the party people who took me to a rave, and I got to wear a tube
top, and I stuffed cash in a caged go-go boy's speedo?
Mitchell : We're still party people.
Cameron : Oh, Joanne, before I forget, can I get a punch? One away from a free
potpie.
Claire : If that was your gay card, it would be revoked.
Mitchell : Okay, you know what, Claire? You're being a little High School you.
Claire : I am sorry, Mitchell, but I get one free night, and I can't spend it at a
place that is a proud supporter of Wilson Elementary.

Haley : Oh, my God.

Girl : Weren't you on my tour this morning?
Haley : Yeah, I'm Haley, and this is my d...
Phil : Big Brother. You bought it for a second. How are you?
Girl : Okay. Anyway, you know what? There is a student mixer going on
tonight. If you wanna go, me and a bunch of other girls are gonna head over
there.
Haley : Oh! Uh, you know what? That's okay. My dad's got this whole thing
planned... but thank you anyway.
Girl : No problem. Well, it was nice meeting you.
Phil : Nice meeting you. How fun is this? Just me and you. I was a little
nervous you wouldn't see what's so special about this place. Not that I'm
pushing you to come here. You know, you're... you're gonna make your own
decisions. You wanna go with them, don't you?
Haley : No, we're doing our thing.
Phil : Yeah, quick. Before they leave.
Haley : Are you sure?

Cameron : We all need to give back, Claire.

Phil : Go. I can handle it. You're not the first girl to leave me at this table with a
plateful of chicken wings. I'm kidding! I wish I was kidding. You weren't
supposed to hear that. Have fun.

Claire : Give me back my night.

Haley : Okay. Love you.

Mitchell : Okay, well, Longinus did invite us to a boutique opening, you
know, cocktails, DJ. But it'll... it'll be a whole scene, though.

Phil : Love you.

Claire : A scene? A scene is perfect. That's great. I will get in the car before you
guys change your mind. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Cameron : So does that mean no potpies?

Claire : Nose job.
Modern Family Season 3x06 page.2

Longines : Butt lift. Last summer, that thing was 4 inches off the ground.

Mitchell : We get very tired.

Claire : What do they do with all the butt they take out?

Claire : I have 3 children. I've been tired since 2005. Let's rally. You're my ride.

Julian : I have a theory.

Julian : If you want to stay out, I can take you home.

Longines : Oh, damn! Here comes my ex.

Claire : Really?

Julian : Who?

Julian : Of course.

Cameron : Randolph?
Mitchell : Marcus?

Claire : Okay. All right, girls, go home, roll up your hair, clap out the lights,
'cause this guy, who I just met, is gonna show me a good time.

Cameron : Lamichael?

Mitchell : Okay, well, if he was straight, this would be just like High School.

Longines : No. Matt. I gotta go.
Claire : Drama. Love it! This is what I wanted.
Julian : Who needs a drink?
Mitchell : I could use a little seltzer water.
Julian : More bubbly, Claire?
Claire : Mm, I will be after I get a drink. See, that's what gay is supposed to be
like.
Mitchell : Okay, I don't know about you, but I got about five minutes of
fabulous left in me.

Jay : This is ridiculous. She's obviously got a pistol under that poncho. How
do you watch this stuff?
Gloria : He's been up there for more than one hour. I can't stand this.
Jay : Who's been up there? Ronaldo's doing the dishes right in front of her.
Gloria : Manny, in his bedroom.
Jay : Gloria, are you even watching this? I'm doing this for you.
Gloria : What does he has in that box that he cannot show to me?

Cameron : Yeah, in my mind, I'm already in our kitchen. I'm watching my
potpie rotate in the microwave.

Jay : Little boys are supposed to keep secrets from their mothers. Wait. The
judge just peeked through the window. Is he interested in Celia now? She
could be his daughter.

Mitchell : Okay. Okay. When did hats come back?

Gloria : I bet it's a birthday gift for me. Yeah, that sounds right.

Cameron : That one's come back about eight times. Pick a side of the room,
lady.

Jay : What's he saying? I've never seen him this mad.

Claire : All right, there's, like, a thousand people waiting for wine. I wanna try
on a couple of dresses, and then Julian here's gonna take us to a club across
town.

Gloria : Wait a minute. I already found my birthday gift underneath his bed.
It's a giant hat. When did hats came back anyway?
Jay : Now she's reaching under the poncho. Like she's gonna shoot Ronaldo.
He's the main character, right?

Cameron : I think we're gonna go home.

Gloria : That's it. I'm going up there.

Claire : What? Why? It's 9:30.

Jay : Wait, Gloria. No. Don't go.

Mitchell : It's 9:30?

Gloria : Why not?

Claire : When did you two become such old women? First, you take me to that
senior center for porridge, and now you can't even stay up past Luke's
bedtime?

Jay : Think about it. 13-year-old boy, talks about girls all day long. We have
more security on these computers than the Pentagon. What do you think he's
doing up there... alone?

Cameron : It's Friday. We get tired on Fridays.

Gloria : Do you think he ordered some movies?
Modern Family Season 3x06 page.3

Jay : Movies, magazines, whatever the hell.
Gloria : How dare do you say that, Jay?! He's a little boy! He's just a boy. I
don't want to talk to you. I'm gonna take a walk.
Jay : Gloria, come on. Come back. I know you're not mad at me. You just... Oh!
What'd she do? Ronaldo!

Mitchell : This isn't our Prius! They... they must've given us the wrong one at
the valet. That's why the Bluetooth isn't working.
Cameron : We stole a car? Are you serious?
Longines : What's happening?
Cameron : Oh, we stole a car. Uh, we gotta go.
Mitchell : Okay, we did not steal a car, Cam. It was given to us.

Phil : Wang chung! Pay up, gentlemen! Yes! Thank you! Really? That's so nice.
Another pitcher, my good woman.
Phil : Claire would have killed me if she'd known that I let Haley go off alone
while I chilled in a bar with some undergrads, but I happen to trust my
daughter. Also, I was tracking her location with the GPS on her phone.

Cameron : Why are you giving me attitude? You're the one that stole a car.
Mitchell : How is this a stolen car?! How?!
Cameron : I don't know! I'm confused! Do you have an aspirin?
Mitchell : This isn't my car!

Boy : Pi Chi house?

Claire : Hey, Lukie. Hi. What's going on? I'll check. I have it. Well, I could
bring it by and meet you outside in 20 minutes? No, sw... out... out... Outside,
sweetie. Okay. Bye-bye. Do you mind swinging by my kid's sleepover? I gotta
give him this retainer. It's on the way to the club.

Phil : Pi Chi?

Julian : Sure, no problem.

Phil : Fellas, Cedar and Los Alamos. That's, uh...

Claire : You are so sweet. Holy pythons, Batman. Do you ever leave the gym?
Mitchell : Oh, come on. Why is my Bluetooth not working? Oh, God. It's
Longinus. He's gonna be so mad at us.
Cameron : Hey, Longe. Don't be mad at us for leaving.
Longines : I went back to our spot, and everybody was gone. Who does that to
a sister?!
Mitchell : We're sorry, but the sitter called, and, uh, Lily was running a fever.
So... we feel even worse about dumping Claire on you and your hot date.
Cameron : Who is gorgeous, by the way. Seems super funny, too. Perfect for
you.
Longines : Please, I wish that was a date. He's my trainer, and he's straight.
Cameron : What? Julian's straight. Oh, I love it when a straight person and a
gay person go out together.

Julian : Uh, no. Actually, I'm a trainer and a masseur.
Claire : Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to try out that second one. Zip, please.
Julian : I gotta say, this night is turning out to be a lot more fun than I
expected.
Claire : I've got two kids at sleepovers and one upstate with daddy. The fun is
just beginning.
Mitchell : Unbelievable. The valet gave our car away to someone, like, and
hour and a half ago.
Cameron : You know what that means. Our potpies could be anywhere by
now.

Longines : I'd love it a lot more if he was gay.

Mitchell : Y... they probably went home. If... if we knew their address, maybe
we could see if our car was there.

Mitchell : Oh, my God. This isn't our car.

Cameron : Oh, yeah. And how do you propose we do that?

Cameron : What?

Car's GPS : Calculating route home.
Modern Family Season 3x06 page.4

Cameron : Oh, you're good. Oh, and look. Only .6 miles away.

Mitchell : Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

Car's GPS : Prepare to turn right in 500 feet.

Cameron : What's happening?!

Mitchell : Notice how she didn't wait until after the turn to tell me, Cam?
Cameron : Really? This? Now?

Woman : I can't believe you came back here, you filthy, cheating pig! Where is
she? Where is she?!

Mitchell : I'm just...

Mitchell : I'm trying! We are in a rut!

Cameron : Oh, look. They went to see Jay-Z. We almost went to see Jay-Z,
didn't we?

Cameron : Really? You wanna talk about that right now?

Mitchell : No, no, no, 'cause remember it started at 8:30.

Cameron : Ohh!

Cameron : Oh, yeah, which meant he wouldn't have gone on until 10:00.

Mitchell : Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

Mitchell : And then that parking nightmare.

Cameron : We are victims of a hate crime right now!

Cameron : Oh, and those stairs.

Cameron : Go! Go! Oh, my God

Mitchell : No, we are stuck! We're in an actual rut. We're stuck.

Mitchell : Okay, I'm hearing it now. Is Claire right? Are we in a rut?
Cameron : Well, we might be, especially compared to these people. Look at
this. Cancun luggage tickets. A parking pass to Yosemite. A triathlon bib. This
is living.
Mitchell : No, but you know what? We have Lily, okay? I know. You can't do
that with a child.
Cameron : They have a car seat.
Mitchell : Okay, fine, we're in a rut.
Car's GPS : Destination ahead in 900 feet.
Mitchell : You know, maybe we just need to be around more stimulating
people.
Cameron : Well, we're gonna be in about 900 feet.
Mitchell : It's not the craziest idea. They seem like fun people.
Cameron : Yeah, and maybe we can be new couples friends with them. You
know, we can go out to concerts, try exciting new food, maybe do some luxury
camping.
Mitchell : Yeah, hitch our wagon to their star and see how fast they spice up
our life.
Car's GPS : You have arrived.
Cameron : I believe we have.
Woman : You dumb son of a bitch!

Phil : Oh, no, you don't.
Haley : Dad, what are you doing here?
Phil : What's this, buddy.
Ben : Ginger ale.
Phil : Oh, really? 'Cause is smells... Okay, it smells like ginger ale. But that
doesn't prove anything.
Haley : What the hell?
Phil : We are leaving.
Haley : I'm having a nice time with...
Phil : With this clown? And by the way, it's a little cliche to pick someone who
looks exactly like your dad. I got your number, Pi Chi. I know you.
Haley : Yeah, you do. This is Ben Ford. He's in my class. He's visiting, too.
Ben : You were my T-ball coach. My dad's your doctor. He's right over there.
Haley : What is wrong with you? Are you trying to ruin college for me before I
even get here?
Phil : No, I-I'm not. I am so sorry. You are not a clown. You were an excellent
backup shortstop. Alecia. Bruce. Go, bullfrogs... Dogs! Go, bulldogs. Claire!
Jay : Wow. Really? No, it's just a shock, is all.
Modern Family Season 3x06 page.5

Gloria : Jay?

Manny : The web site said it would.

Jay : So Celia's carrying the judge's baby. No wonder she shot him. She's
hormonal.

Gloria : Listen, Manny, you're already intelligent and beautiful and funny. If
you get tall, you're going to have everything, and those poor boys are not
gonna have anything to compete with you. Look at this. You have a mark on
your head now. I'm gonna go get you some ice, okay?

Gloria : Who are you talking to?
Jay : The housekeeper. Maria, I've gotta go. Thanks a lot.
Gloria : Jay, I need you to talk to Manny.
Jay : What?
Gloria : Well, if he's doing what you think he's doing, then he needs to talk to
a man. I don't want him to be ashamed of anything.
Jay : Then you don't want to send me in there.
Gloria : Yeah, but what if... if he has questions? What if he doesn't know how
to...

Manny : That's a lot of pretty words, but they don't help me tomorrow.
Jay : Sorry, kid. It's just one of those things. You get taller when you get taller.
Why don't you get ready for bed? Ah, jeez. You know, when I was your age, I
started working out to get the girls.
Manny : You think that would help?
Jay : Yeah. So tomorrow, we start working out. Okay? Maybe I'll even show
you a few pull-ups on, uh, this bad boy here, huh? You see that? Pretty soon,
that's how strong... you're gonna be.

Jay : Gloria, Gloria, whatever he's going through, he can work it out himself.
Manny : Help! I'm stuck!

Luke : Thanks, mom.

Gloria : Ay, no, Jay, go. I beg of you! Go! Go! Go!

Claire : I don't want them to know I was here.

Jay : Gloria. I'm extremely reluctant to do this.

Luke : Okay.

Manny : Please hurry!

Holly : Oh, Claire, I thought that was you. Thank God. Come in.

Gloria : Ay, no. I cannot look at this.

Claire : I can't. 'Cause I'm sick, remember? Sorry.

Jay : What the hell?

Holly : Well, my DVD player just broke, and none of us know how "Gone with
the wind" ends. But you saw it, right? I...

Manny : I can't get down, Jay.
Gloria : What? What happened to Manny?! Ay, somebody say something to
me!

Woman : Oh, is that Claire?

Jay : Gloria, it's okay. Come on in.

Bethenny : Can you tell us what happened?

Gloria : Okay.

Claire : I could, but I don't want to ruin it for you.

Jay : He was hanging from that bar up there.

Holly : Claire. Just tell us.

Gloria : What? Why? What do you have on your head?
Manny : It's a weighted helmet to stretch me so I can get taller.

Claire : Um... Scarlett is... really mad at Clark Gable because, um, he says so
many bad things. And didn't he, um, burn down a farm or something?

Gloria : Manny! Why do you have to get tall now?

Holly : Claire, have you been drinking?

Manny : Love, mom. Why else? I lost Bella to Durkus because, in her words,
"he's tall." Everybody else is getting taller but me. You think it's the coffee?

Claire : I had a hot toddy. Made one for my throat.

Holly : Yeah.

Holly : Pretty dressed up for a night in bed, right?

Gloria : No. Maybe. But... but hanging downside up is not gonna help you.
Modern Family Season 3x06 page.6

Claire : Yeah, I-I just threw on the first thing I could find... when Luke called,
and it was just right there on the chair.

Phil : Please? Please, just listen to me for one second.

Bethenny : She has a stamp on her hand.

Haley : Go away! Stop following me!

Claire : Okay. All right. Before we bust out the pitchforks and the torches, may
I remind you that I've driven every one of your children home and Heimliched
at least one, Bethenny.

Officer : Hey, you wanna tell me why you're bothering this young lady?

Julian : Hi.
Holly : Hello.
Julian : This is totally inappropriate. But could I use your bathroom? Sorry.
You kept pushing the drinks.
Claire : I... friend. Gay friend. Gay.
Julian : I'm not gay.
Claire : Yes, you are.
Julian : I-I'm not gay. I'm... I'm French. You thought I was gay?
Claire : Are you serious right now?
Julian : Well, are you? You've been throwing yourself at me all night.
Claire : No, no. No, I have not.
Holly : Bethenny, grab the Pinot.
Claire : Bethenny, do not grab the Pinot.
Julian : You undressed in front of me. You squeezed my arm. You asked me for
a massage. What was all that?
Claire : That was... that was me safely objectifying a gay person.
Holly : Wow, Claire! When I wrote "don't ever change" in your yearbook, I
didn't mean it like this.
Claire : Oh, ease up, Holly. Okay, I lied. I lied, but I get one night to myself,
and I just wanted to spend it with some fun gay people. It's not my fault this
one decided to be straight.
Julian : I've always been straight. Oh, you don't get to talk! I took fashion
advice from you! Oh, my God. Do I even look good in this dress? No. Not you.
It's really short, isn't it?
Holly : It's short.

Phil : Oh, no, no, no, no. Officer, this is my daughter. Tell him.
Haley : Tonight, I don't know who you are.
Phil : She's... she's joking. I'm not dangerous. In fact, I-I-I helped to put all the
lights on this path. 20 years ago, some friends and I took back the night. So... II think I just... I embarrassed her a little.
Haley : "A little"? That sweatshirt embarrasses me "a little."
Officer : Yep, that's a daughter.
Haley : Tonight was insane. Why did you have to act like that?
Phil : You were at that party. I see you talking to frat boys, and...
Haley : Isn't that why we're here, so I can experience college? I mean, what are
you gonna do when I actually go?
Phil : I don't know. Freak out, I think. Look... your whole life, my job has been
to protect you... a job I kinda love. Now I feel like I'm being forced into early
retirement. I just needed to find you and make sure you were okay... for as
long as I still get to do that.
Haley : Just like you... piss me off and then say something sweet. I'm not
leaving until the fall.
Phil : Maybe by then I can figure out how to put a force field around you. I've
been working on that one since the first time I tried to fasten you into your car
seat. I pinched your chunky little thigh.
Haley : You know you basically just called me fat. So... is it really fun?
Phil : What? No!
Jay : We all struggle with limitations... Some we're willing to accept...
Cameron : You know, I just wanna be home, reading on opposite ends of the
sofa.

Claire : Yeah.
Modern Family Season 3x06 page.7

Jay : And some we're not.
Manny : I'm so embarrassed I did that.
Gloria : I'm just so happy that that was all it was.
Manny : Why? What'd you think I was doing?
Jay : It's never too late to grow in life.
Haley : Oh, my God!
Jay : "Thanks to our patented lengthenator, you can increase your height by up
to 4 inches."
Gloria : I can't believe he would spend $50 on this thing.
Jay : I know. He could've got a 2-year subscription to "Playboy" for that.
Gloria : He's not getting the "Playboy" ever! He's a little boy!
Cameron : Wouldn't it be great if we woke up tomorrow and our car had
found its way home?
Mitchell : Yeah, I feel that's not the way it's gonna happen.
Cameron : Happened on the farm one time. A tornado scooped up one of our
calves, dropped it who knows where. Six months later, a full-grown cow
comes walking up the driveway... same markings, same moo. That night, we...
Mitchell : We ate like kings.
Cameron : Okay, I've told it before. Oh, my gosh! It's our car!
Man : I see you've met my wife.

Modern Family Season 3x06 page.8

3x07 : Treehouse

Gloria : It's majestic.

Claire : Honey! What is all this?

Darlene : Last week, Shorty took me to see the Cirque du soleil... It's like a
circus, but classy. So if you like elephants, don't hold your breath.

Phil : Hey!

Shorty : She's so cute.

Haley : Hey mom! I'm trying to write a stupid college essay question and I
really don't even know where to start.

Gloria : Jay hates the crowds, the beach, the rainbows.

Claire : OK, what's the question? Tell me.
Haley : "What's the biggest obstacle you ever had to overcome?" Didn't my 3rd
Grade teacher said I had like ADD or something?
Claire : Oh, no honey. She said you couldn't ADD. She put it that way because
she also knew you couldn't S-P-E-O-L.

Jay : Rainbows? It's just colors in the sky. Do we have to pull over every time
and take a picture? Shame.
Shorty : There's an expression in Italian, Jay... Dammi la tua mano e corriamo
uniti per tutta la vita. "Give me your hand and we will run together our whole
lives."
Gloria : Jay also hates running.

Haley : Wait, slow down.
Claire : Sweetheart. What's this?

[OPENING CREDITS]

Phil : We talked about this last week. I said I'm building Luke a treehouse, you
said fine. You know? Sometimes I think you just turn me out.

Waitress : Here you go.
Mitchell : Oh, thank you.

Phil : I never told her. She just would have said "no."

Waitress : And here you go.
Cameron : Oh. What is this?

Claire : I don't remember agreeing to this, Phil. This is like the time you
backed down the driveway with a hang glider sticking out of the car.

Waitress : You said to knock your socks off.

Phil : If you'd let me keep that, those geese would have followed me to the
wetlands.

Waitress : Well, two more of those, and you won't be wearing any underwear
either.

Claire : You would have died.

Cameron ! Oh! Look...

Phil : A hero.

Mitchell : Cam, down. Down.

Cameron : Oh, well, look. It's already working!

Waitress : Maybe later.
Shorty : So we spread out a nice blanket, opened up a bottle of vino, and
watched the sun set over the water.

Cameron : Oh, okay, maybe... maybe later. Did you hear that? Waitress is
flirting with me.

Darlene : It was majestic.
Shorty : Mm. Majestic.

Mitchell : No, no. She's not flirting with you. She's... she's trolling for tips,
okay? She totally knows you're gay.

Gloria : Why? Why we never have the picnic?

Cameron : How would she know I'm gay?

Jay : Who wants to sit on a blanket? There's no back support.

Mitchell : Uh, maybe it's the way you ordered a drink-a-doodle-doo.
Modern Family Season 3x07 page.1

Gloria : Ay, no, I wouldn't want to...
Mitchell : Cam has this crazy theory that if he were straight... And Julia
Roberts were single... They'd be dating.

Darlene : No, no! You'd be doing me a favor. Shorty never wants to stop, and I
could use a break.

Cameron : It's not crazy. I met her once at an A.I.D.S. walk, and our chemistry
was palpable.

Shorty : You hear that Jay? I never stop.
Jay : All I hear is she could use a break.

Mitchell : No, you handed her a bottle of water.
Cameron : And her fingers lingered.

Cameron : Hey! Oh, my God! How are you?

Mitchell : Because you wouldn't let go.

Katie : Hey. Hey!
Cameron : Wow. Look at you. You look fantastic.

Cameron : I could totally pick up any woman in here.

Katie : Thank you. So do you.

Crispin If by that, you mean lift her off the ground, then yes, I'll give you that.

Cameron : How long has it been?

Cameorn : I for sure could be a womanizer.

Katie : It feels like forever.

Mitchell : Or you could be someone who just stepped out of a machine called
the womanizer.

Cameron : Yeah.

Cameron : Okay, you know what? That's it. Pick anyone in here. If I can get
their number, you do the laundry for a month. If I fail, I'll do it.

Cameron : Oh, let's see. I think it was at Dave's thing.

Mitchell : Okay. I hate doing laundry. So, um... No, um... Oh, okay. Right here.
Her.
Cameron : Okay, great. Great. Just get rid of my flair...
Crispin Whoa. Where did Cam go?

Katie : Um, when is the last time we saw each other?
Katie : You know what? I'm sorry. I don't know if you've heard. I was in a
terrible car accident, and ever since the coma, I have a really hard time placing
names and faces. So who are you again?
Cameron : Oh, my God. I am so sorry. It was just a clever way to try to
approach you. We don't know each other.

Mitchell : I don't know. Where is he?

Katie : I've never been in a coma. But you so deserved that. That was the worst
pick-up ever.

Shorty : Dinner was absolutely wonderful.

Cameron : Oh, my God! That was genius! And mean! Now I know why we're
old fake friends. Oh. Can I buy you a drink?

Darlene : Amazing.
Shorty : Hey, you know what? Why don't you guys come salsa dancing with
us tomorrow night?

Katie : Yeah. I'm Katie.
Cameron : Cameron.

Darlene : Oh, yeah! That would be great!
Gloria : It sounds like so much fun. I love salsa dancing. Jay, let's go salsa
dancing with them. Look. Why not?

Cameron : If she were a hot guy, I would never have been that smooth. It's
ironic. Like the gift of the vagi.

Jay : I just bought that pay-per-view fight. I tell you what... we'll compromise.
We'll watch the fight. We'll eat salsa.

Katie : There you go.

Shorty : Who needs him? Come dancing with us.

Cameron : Thank you. Nice to meet you.

Claire : Well... You're lactose-intolerant.

Katie : You, too. Bye!

Haley : Oh, "dear college, cheese makes me gassy. See you in September."

Cameron : Bye! Wham, bam, thank you, Cam.

Claire : Sweetie, you're not really starting your essays "dear college," are you?

Mitchell : Seriously? You got her number?

Haley : What difference does it make? I've lived a boring, sheltered, pathetic
life.

Cameron : Sure did. And all my shirts get ironed, and their seams should
appear straight, just like their owner.

Claire : I am sorry we have made things too easy and comfortable for you.

Luke : Should you be using screws instead of nails?

Haley : Oh, you should be! It is all your fault! You have shielded me from
everything interesting and dangerous!

Phil : America was built with nails, son.

Claire : You are blaming me because I kept you from getting hurt?

Luke : So was that gazebo you built for our 4th of July party.

Haley : Gaby's mom's a hoarder. That essay practically writes itself.

Phil : I'm telling you, you are gonna love this bad boy. You know what can't
climb trees?

Claire : Maybe it is our fault. But did you ever consider there's a reason?

Luke : Raccoons?

Claire : There's a reason why we were so easy on you.

Phil : Worries. Raccoons can and will get up here, so don't leave any food, or
they'll get territorial and attack.

Haley : I don't understand.

Luke : Are you sure this is a good idea?

Haley : Old enough for what?

Phil : Are you kidding me? You're gonna have so much fun hanging out up
here with your buddies. Trust me, when you get older, it all changes.

Claire : The truth. Okay, come on. Gotta show you somethin'. We're gonna go
for a ride.

Luke : Why?

Haley : Mom, just tell me.

Phil : Well, life gets in the way. Did I just say "wife gets in the way"? 'Cause
sometimes I do that.

Claire : You are my mom, right?

Luke : Nope, you're good. And you have lots of friends.
Phil : Yeah, I have work friends, and your mom and I have couples friends,
and there are my college friends, but they're scattered all over the country. It's
not the same as just shouting out to your neighborhood buddies, "Hey, fellas!
I'm up here in the tree house!" Uhh! I got to fix that... board.
Haley : I can't do this.
Claire : Why are you so frustrated?
Haley : Because I've never had any obstacles to overcome.
Claire : Oh, honey, that's not true.

Haley : What are you talking about?

Claire : Oh, honey, you're old enough now.

Mitchell : Oh, hey.
Cameron : I'm a bad man.
Mitchell : Oh, no. What did you eat?
Cameron : Mitchell, remember the girl I met last night?
Mitchell : How can I forget her? She's super famous for having the world's
worst gay-dar.
Cameron : How could I be so cavalier with her emotions? You know, we had a
real connection. She gave me her number, and right now she's probably sitting
by the phone waiting for me to call. I don't think you understand how
charmed she was by me.

Haley : Really? Name one.
Modern Family Season 3x07 page.3

Mitchell : Oh, my God. Where did you get all this self-confidence?

Gloria : And we were home by 8:30 with no boat.

Cameron : I won cutest baby at the 1974 Jasper county fair. People at the time
said I could go gerber. You know what? I'm calling her.

Jay : What do you want from me? I don't like dancing.

Mitchell : What?

Jay : Yeah, right. How about coconut?

Cameron : No, I can't carry this around. I have to come clean so she can move
on with her life.

Gloria : Who doesn't like the coconut, hmm? Who? And anyways, I'm going
dancing with or without you.

Mitchell : This is crazy. She is not waiting...

Jay : Fine. I hope you have a good time with Shorty.

Cameron : Hi. Katie. It's Cam. First ring. I was hoping I would call, too.

Gloria : I don't need Shorty! I won't have any problem finding a partner on my
own!

Mitchell : Oh, smooth.

Gloria : I don't like sherbet.

Cameron : So listen, I forgot to mention something last night, and I'm... I'm
actually not really quite sure how to say this.

Manny : Wow. Way to rub it in, mom.

Mitchell : I'm a gay guy.

Mitchell : How'd it go, heartbreaker?

Cameron : Um, it's actually somewhat delicate.

Cameron : That is one classy lady... which is why I couldn't tell her.

Mitchell : As am I, on account of the gay.

Mitchell : What?

Cameron : No, no, I had a great time with you, too, Katie. It's... well, it's just
that...

Cameron : Well... I just couldn't do it on the phone. She seemed so excited to
hear from me, and I'm very bad at disappointing people, Mitchell.

Mitchell : I don't dig the ladies.

Mitchell : Not all people.

Cameron : No, no. And I want you to sit... I want you to have a seat on a
chaise lounge.

Cameron : Mama was right when she said my charm was like a wild stallion...
if not properly bridled, it'll bust down a barn.
Mitchell : Okay, you wanna get rid of your girlfriend? Tell her that story.

Jay : Hey, you wanna go out and grab some dinner before the fight tonight?

Cameron : Maybe I will when she comes over. She's coming over.

Gloria : No, thank you.

Mitchell : Are you serious?

Jay : Wanna eat at home? I'll grill some steaks, open a bottle of wine.

Cameron : She said she was in the area running errands. What was I supposed
to say, "don't come over"? Well, I guess I could have said that, but it's too late
now, plus I wanna break it to her gently. So come on. Help me un-gay this
place.

Gloria : Whatever you want, because I'm not going to be here.
Manny : She's going salsa dancing without me.
Gloria : Ay, Manny, I told you, it's a 21 and over club.
Manny : A forbidden dance floor. Only makes me want it more.
Jay : Wait a second. You're going dancing with Shorty and Darlene?
Gloria : Yes, because even though he's old like you, he still likes to have fun.
Jay : We like to have fun. Last week I took you to dinner, went to the boat
show, got some sherbet?

Mitchell : You know what? I'll make it less gay by half.
Cameron : Oh, these flowers should go, too.
Mitchell : You mean the ones underneath the portrait of you cuddling another
man?
Cameron : Oh, good catch. Aw.

Modern Family Season 3x07 page.4

Jay : Manny.
Manny : What's up, big guy?

Mitchell : It's just something that some people take at clubs to, you know,
loosen up.

Jay : How hard is it to learn this salsa dancing stuff?

Jay : You take this?

Manny : Not hard at all. It's about tapping into your emotion, your passion,
and your inner fire.

Mitchell : A gay man who hates dancing lives in a sad and lonely little world.
This just melts your inhibitions, and... and you can dance all night, plus it
gives you a raging...

Jay : Crap!
Jay : I stink at dancing. First dance at our wedding, Gloria was all graceful and
gorgeous, and I was all big and clunky. Like that scene from "Beauty and the
beast." Actually, that was the song. Manny picked it. He didn't like me back
then.

Jay : I don't wanna... I don't like this at all.
Mitchell : Just hold on to it. Just in case. Come on. It's fine.
Manny : Jay, I wanna show you something. A farmer in New Zealand taught a
pig to dance.
Mitchell : Oh.
Manny : See how he keeps his snout up?

Manny : Back straight. Okay. Do as I do. Other leg. Okay, stop marching.
You're dancing, not invading Poland.
Mitchell : Hello, hi! I'm looking for Jay Pritchett. He's about 6'2", tough guy,
wrestles with homophobia...

Claire : Yep. This is it.
Haley : This is what?

Jay : The hell are you doing here?

Claire : This. I-I can't do this. I can't get out of the car. I'm sorry. I'm too
embarrassed.

Mitchell : Uh, I had to get out of the house. Cam needed a little alone time
with his new girlfriend. Don't ask.

Haley : Would you just tell me what's going on?

Jay : Don't tell.
Mitchell : What's going on here?
Manny : He's learning to dance, but he's just so tense.
Jay : It's not working out.
Manny : 'Cause you're not letting go.
Jay : I'm trying. Don't you think I want to be all smooth and make your mom
happy out there? But I just can't do it, that's all.
Manny : Jay, I'm not giving up on you.
Mitchell : Okay. Hey, Manny, would you give us a second? Thanks. Dad, look,
I-I know this is weird, but you and I are a lot alike. We're self-conscious, okay?
So, um, here. Just...
Jay : The hell is this?

Claire : Okay. I-I want you to go read what's carved in that tree.
Haley : Mom, you're freaking me out.
Claire : Just do it. Do it, Haley. Have fun getting home! There's your obstacle!
Haley : What?! Are you kidding me?!
Phil : Oh! Son of a... Brisket! Why does that keep happening? Maybe I need a
nail gun.
Luke : Okay, that's it! I'm out!
Phil : What do you mean, you're out? Where are you going?
Luke : Dad, no offense, but I've seen you with a glue gun. I think a nail is
gonna be harder to get out of my hair.
Phil : No, don't go! I'm doing this for you!
Luke : Are you, dad? Are you?
Modern Family Season 3x07 page.5

Phil : The kid made me think with that one. Who was I really doing this for?
Luke : Sometimes I just say, "are you, dad? Are you?" Because he gets real
quiet and doesn't notice when I walk away.
Katie : It's weird, because I feel so comfortable around you already. You know,
last night when I got home, I just started thinking about all of the fun things
that we could do together, you know? I don't wanna scare you off, but my
sister's getting married in a couple of weeks, and I so don't wanna go to that
thing alone. Maybe you could be my date?

Cameron : I was just a stupid bar bet. My boyfriend... oh, he's here... bet me
that I couldn't get a beautiful woman's number. And as a proud gay man, I
know it shouldn't matter, but I-I just wish everyone could find me attractive.
Oh. But now he's gonna get to gloat, and I guess I deserve it.
Mitchell : Hi... hi. How's... how's it going? Hello.
Cameron : This is Katie, and, uh, it turns out, well...
Katie : No, actually. It doesn't turn out well. Because I thought I finally met a
nice, funny guy, who is also hot! And now he's telling me he's gay?! He's, like,
the least gay person I have ever met in my entire life! And I thought he was
the one! And I even told my mom about him! You better cherish him!
Mitchell : Wow.

Cameron : Katie, you're an amazing woman. You're smart, you're beautiful,
and how fun is that handbag? This is gonna come as a little bit of a shock. I'm
fairly gay. I don't know why I said that. I'm... I'm totally gay. Just gay.

Katie : Are you sure you're gay?

Katie : You're telling me you're gay?
Katie : Why?

Cameron : Yes. Yes. Look... You're gonna find somebody, because you're an
amazing girl, Katie. You're the whole package. I just prefer somebody who has
one.

Cameron : I was born that way. I mean, you know, it's just...

Katie : Okay.

Katie : No, why are you telling me? I mean, I know you're gay. It's obvious.

Mitchell : Oh... my... God!

Cameron : Well, it's not that... it's not that obvious.

Cameron : That was a lot of girl tongue! I think I need a drink-a-doodle-doo.

Katie : Well, yeah. The way you talk and walk and dress and your theatrical
hand gestures...

Haley : What was that?

Cameron : Yeah.

Cameron : No.
Mitchell : Cam.

Cameron : I do not have theatrical hand gestures. Okay, maybe I am
moderately... expressive. But why would you give me your number?

Claire : Hello, Haley. How was your day?

Katie : Oh, because I want a gay friend... someone I can dish with, give me
guy advice, and I can shop with...

Claire : You're welcome.

Cameron : Those are totally offensive stereotypes.

Haley : I have no money, no cell phone...
Haley : What?!

Katie : We could go see Julia Roberts movies together.

Claire : I listened to you. I stopped coddling you, and look... you overcame an
obstacle.

Cameron : I know her, and she's as nice as she seems on screen.

Haley : Oh! Yeah! I did! I grew up normal despite my crazy mom!

Katie : Shut up. Really? Is she?

Claire : Well, that sounds like the beginning of a great essay. "Dear college..."
Oh, honey, if you get stuck, let me know, and I'll make you sleep out in the
yard.

Cameron : She is, yeah.
Katie : Wait, what... so you were pretending to be straight, and hitting on me?

Modern Family Season 3x07 page.6

Haley : You're psychotic!

Shorty : I do surprise you.

Claire : Use spell check!

Darlene : No, you don't. You never surprise me...

Darlene : Aah! Don't just sit there! Get out here!

Andre : That's gonna be a hell of a tree house.

Gloria : I'm good, I'm good.

Phil : Oh, thanks. I'm trying. It's for my son, but he's kind of lost interest.

Darlene : Okay!
Man : Hola! You're looking so good! How long has it been?

Andre : It's kind of like my daughter with the dog. Which is why I'm the one
out here doing this.

Gloria : We don't know each other. Go away.

Phil : Did you just move in?

Man : Fair enough. Hola! You're looking so good. How long has it been?

Andre : Lived here eight years. You?

Darlene : What was wrong with that guy?

Phil : 12.

Shorty : Yeah, I would have danced with him. He's got nice shoulders.

Andre : Huh.

Gloria : Aw, you know, salsa is so intimate and sensual that it feels wrong to
do it with somebody else that is not Jay.

Phil : Huh.

Shorty : Aw. You know, Darlene feels the same way. If I wasn't here, she's be
holding up the wall.

Andre : You know, me and my friends, we, uh, we built a tree house when I
was a kid. We spent hours in that thing. Loved it.
Phil : Me, too.

Darlene : Yeah. A wall of men.

Andre : You need any help?

Gloria : You know, I think I should go home to my loving husband and pull
him close and tell him that I danced with 20 men.

Phil : Yes, a lot. But I-I don't wanna bother you.

Jay : He's not home. He's in a dicey neighborhood worried about his car.
Gloria : Yay! Hey! Jay!

Andre : Only thing that bothers me is that drunken Amish roof you got up
there.

Jay : What, are we gonna kiss or dance?

Phil : Do you even have a level? I did, but I might have gotten frustrated and
thrown it into your yard.

Gloria : Let's dance!

Andre : Let me find it. I'll be right over.
Phil : Thanks. I'm Phil, by the way.

Jay : I'm dead set against drugs. "Just say no" and all that stuff. But I thought,
just this once for Gloria. And if I was gonna make a complete ass of myself, I
didn't wanna remember it.
Mitchell : The big drug I gave him... baby aspirin. Orange-flavored. He could
have chewed it.

Andre : I'm Andre. Nice to meet you, Phil.
Phil : Nice to meet you, Andre.
Phil : So I guess I was wrong when I said once you get older, it's harder to
make new friends.
Andre : Honey! The dude in the tree is cool!

Darlene : : Home come you never surprise me like that?
Modern Family Season 3x07 page.7

Phil : Andre, it turns out, is an orthopedic surgeon, handy with tools, and a
great guy to hang out with. Plus he's a badass black man that gives me extra
street cred. That's his joke. He's my brotha from a different motha.
Andre : What was that?
Phil : Different...
Andre : That's not it.
Phil : What is it?
Andre : It's "brother from another mother."
Phil : Brotha from anotha motha...
Andre : Slow down. Slow it down.
Phil : Brotha from another motha.
Andre : Forget it. Don't... just don't say it. Forget it.

3x08 : After The Fire
Claire : Oh, thank you so much for the donations.

Mitchell : Oh! Ohh! Oh, God.
Cameron : I sleep clown.

Woman : I wish I could do more, it's just a bunch of out of date clothes.
Claire : Oh, I'm sure it's great.

Claire : Dad, you're gonna kill yourself.
Jay : I got it! We're on a schedule here. I still have to pick up the truck.

Claire : Three weeks ago, our neighbours the Rands lost their house and
everything they owned in a fire. Fortunately, nobody was hurt.

Gloria : If you want him to stop lifting things, put all this in grocery bags and
turn the TV on to a football game.

Phil : And fortunately, they're friends with wonder woman over here.

Phil : Oh! Take this phone away from me!

Claire : I'm hardly wonder woman.

Claire : Why?

Phil : She mobilized the community to donate clothes, furniture, appliances,
all to help them start over in their new rental.
Claire : Which you found them.

Phil : Two of our best brokers left to start their own agency, and the office
gossip is flying. But I want today to be about the Rands... And if I have this...
Oh, my God! Those guys took two secretaries and the tube dude with them!

Phil : I'm no Wonder Woman. Rand-aid was her idea.

Gloria : Who's the tube dude?

Claire : It wasn't my idea to call it "Rand-aid."

Phil : You know, the blowy guy that attracts all the attention. This guy...

Phil : Okay, fine. I'm Wonder Woman.

Gloria : Ah, si, I've seen him. He goes down over there, and then he shakes up.
And goes down in there, and then...

Jay : Terrible tragedy.
Gloria : They're our closest friends.
Jay : We know them. Uh, Manny and their son Reuben are tight. In fact, I put
in one of their closets. Not that it matters, but it was the only structure to
survive the fire.
Gloria : Por favor, don't even say that word! In my country it is considered
very, very bad luck when your house burns down.

Phil : You almost got it.
Gloria : And then goes down.
Mitchell : Hi, hi, sorry. We would have been here sooner, but this one had a
wardrobe crisis.
Cameron : You know, it's a somber occasion, and all my tops are too joyful.
Mitchell : You do not want our problems.
Cameron : No. Oh, here, Jay, let me help.
Jay : No, I got it. Aah! My back!

Mitchell : They lived a block away from us.

Claire : Dad!

Cameron : Smoke was everywhere. I was so upset, I couldn't sleep for days. Of
course, Mitchell won't let me take anything.

Phil : No, Jay, that's not quite it. Remember, you got air blowing through you,
so it's more like... And then out. And then out.

Mitchell : Well, Cam, we both know why. Some people have been known to
sleepwalk or even sleep drive on that medication. Cam's reaction is much
worse.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Modern Family Season 3x08 page.1

Jay : Leave me alone. I'm fine. I've gotta pick up that truck.

Manny : Mm-hmm.

Cameron : I'd be happy to get the truck.

Luke : That you control with your phone? The one I asked for?

Jay : I don't think so. It's a pretty big truck.

Gloria : Okay, when your house burns down, you get one of these. Now don't
burn your house down.

Cameron : Oh. Is it... is it bigger than the combine I've been driving since I was
12 years old? Or the Windrow tractor with the Macdon header that I drove to
and parallel parked at my High School prom? Hmm?

Luke : How lucky is Reuben?
Manny : So lucky.

Mitchell : At least something got plowed that night.

Luke : You know what? I say we take this thing out and see how she flies.

Cameron : Heard that!

Manny : I don't know. My mom got it for Reuben.

Jay : Oh, son of bitch!

Luke : Oh, so now he won't even share his toys?

Phil : Your low back is in spasm, Jay. I can massage that out for you.

Manny : He never does.

Jay : I'm fine.

Luke : Screw that guy!

Claire : Dad, you don't know what you're missing. Phil is a magician.

Manny : Yaeh! You're a terrible influence.

Phil : And a licensed masseur. Before I heard the siren song of residential real
estate, I was bitten by the rub bug.

Luke : You need me.

Mitchell : No, he's... he's amazing. I had this knot in my leg, two minutes with
Phil and it was gone.
Jay : I'm sorry, but I think you might have a higher tolerance for a man's hands
on your body than I do.
Mitchell : Charming.
Gloria : Ay, don't be an idiot. Let Phil help you.
Jay : Fine.
Phil : Great! I'll just go get the room ready. I'll think you'll be surprised with
what these hands can do.
Cameron : Really? Can they drive a bobcat skid-steer with a bucket grapple
through a school hallway on a dare? Because these can and have.

Gloria : Claire, in case you want to add something, I put the box of dresses
outside and this is the box of snicker snackers.
Claire : Mm. Thanks. Mitchell, we did have something to add to this box of,
um... Snicker snackers. What?
Mitchell : English is not her first language. She's just trying to help.
Claire : Mitchell, come on. You can't do that. You can't just change the rules.
This is what we do. When Gloria says something silly, we innocently laugh
behind her back.
Mitchell : She's had a rough week, all right? She's really worried about tia
Maria Cecilia and that surgery. Oh, and then she lost her cell phone at pilates.
Claire : How do you know this?
Mitchell : We have coffee.

Manny : Poor Reuben, huh? Having to rebuild his whole life at age 12.

Claire : Oh. Have? So when did this become, like, a thing?

Luke : Yeah. That blows.

Mitchell : What's the big deal? We're friends. I like Gloria.

Manny : I know we're both shaken up, but let's watch the language.

Claire : Uh, it's no big deal. I have nothing against her, I just think... Oh! Mm.
All right. So before you get all judge-y, I gave her that vase.

Gloria : Okay, put this in a safe place. It's for Reuben. It's one of those, um,
how do you say again, the takka-takka-takka...

Mitchell : After I gave it to you.

Luke : Is that the helicopter with the camera in it...
Modern Family Season 3x08 page.2

Jay : Can you?
Haley : You couldn't part with that T-shirt?

Phil : I can, but I don't need to, because I fixed it forever.

Alex : I love this shirt.

Jay : Just once, I wish he wouldn't make such a big deal about everything.

Haley : You know, you don't have to look the way you look. Amber rand lost
all her clothes in a fire, but she gets to build herself a new wardrobe.

Phil : Okay. Now just disrobe and place the towel over your buttocks.

Haley : Let me burn your clothes.
Claire : Girls, get down here. There's a lot of work to do.
Alex : Ugh. She's in a mood.

Cameron : Riding the open road in a big rig like this sure can work up a man's
powerful appetite.

Haley : You know what we have to do, right?

Alex : We've gone five blocks.

Alex : There's no way you're my real sister!

Cameron : Do you want a burger or not?

Haley : I hate you!
Alex : I can't believe you would ever... you're the most selfish...

Haley : I could eat. Hey, Alex, maybe Uncle Cam will let you borrow his hat
later. You know, since you dress like a dude.

Claire : Okay, That's it! I cannot take the fighting! Just get out of the house.

Alex : I like the way I dress.

Haley : Works every time.
Cameron : You know, I don't even wanna drive the truck anymore even
though on the farm I was...
Jay : I can't take another farm story.
Cameron : Yay!
Jay : You might wanna take someone with you. The thing's been parked there
six months. You're gonna want to hose it down, sweep for spiders.
Claire : Good news, girls. You're going with Uncle Cam.
Cameron : Yay!
Jay : The pain must have been pretty bad if I was asking Phil for help. His
need for my approval is exhausting. In ten years, I've asked him for one
thing... to hook up my wireless printer. He still won't shut up about it.

Haley : Uncle Cam, as her future prom date, will you please talk to her? You
know fashion.
Cameron : First of all, you're each beautiful in your own way, but you're both
playing for second, because I'm too sexy for... this truck.
Alex : I have to say, you do drive it surprisingly well.
Haley : Yeah, who would have thought?
Cameron : Surprising? What, that... that a gay man can drive a truck? You
know, I expect that kind of thinking from Jay's generation. But from our future
generation? No.
Cameron : Wow. This place got crowded.
Haley : Whoa. You're really wedged in there.
Alex : You want us to help guide you out?
Cameron : That question... it was like a hate crime.

Phil : How's that printer working out for you? Still loving that printer, eh? You
know, if your printer breaks from here, I can fix it on my phone.

Cameron : Sorry!
Modern Family Season 3x08 page.3

Haley : Hey, you're really close on this side.

Luke : I like this guy. Where's he been?

Cameron : Yeah, I see it.
Haley : Careful!

Phil : Just relax. Let me know if I'm hurting you.

Cameron : I'm being careful. Gasping? Really? Holding hands? We're not in a
nosedive. Okay, you know what, if it would make you feel better, get out and
guide me. Okay, come on. Let's go.

Jay : Are you kidding me? It's fantastic. I love you. This! I love this!

Haley : Please don't yell at me, but there's not enough room.

Jay : It just slipped out. Those are the worst three words I could say to Phil. I
was just praying he would let it go and not make a big deal about it.

Cameron : Okay, climb over. You're fine.
Phil : Oh, my God. This is huge. Jay, I'm sorry. I need a minute.
Phil : You know, the native Americans believe that burning sage kept bad
energy away.
Jay : How'd that work out for 'em? Get to the back.
Phil : That's the spirit. Thank you. I just need to make sure that the oil is a
perfect 98.6. And it is perfect. Now I want you to take a deep breath and let me
transport you to a land I call relaxistan.
Jay : Oh, what the hell? Get off me. I knew this was a terrible... Oh, mama
Lucian, that's good.

Jay : Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch.
Mitchell : Oh, these are fantastic. Why is Manny getting rid of them?
Gloria : He said that they were last season.
Mitchell : I used to have a pair like these. I can never find 'em anymore.
Gloria : Oh, there's an outlet store. They don't have men's size, but I'm sure the
biggest size for boys would fit you perfectly. I'll take you.
Mitchell : All right. It's a date.

Luke : So you wanna try it?

Claire : Oh. Another date.

Manny : I don't know. I'm still feeling guilty.

Gloria : Claire, I heard what happened with the vase, but I don't want you to
worry about it.

Luke : It's Reuben's helicopter. Reuben is the whole reason we should be doing
this. He's barely living proof that life can change in a second. You gotta grab
what you can when you can.

Claire :: I'm so sorry. I should have told you about that sooner. It just... I have
really been shaken by this whole fire thing. You know, life is so fragile.

Manny : What is this hold you have on me? Wow.

Gloria : I know, like a vase.

Luke : Okay, now ease up.

Claire : You tattled on me?

Manny : Okay, I'm easing up. Okay, it's not working.

Mitchell : She asked me about it. What was I supposed to do? Why are you
making those cruel sounds with your mouth?

Luke : Get ahold of yourself, Manny! She's getting away!
Manny : I can't... I... I can't hold her!
Luke : Give it to me! Mayday! Mayday! Oh, well.
Manny : What do you mean "oh, well"? My mom's gonna kill us.
Luke : Us? You were flying it. I was in the attic packing boxes.

Claire : You don't see it? You're turning Gloria into mom.
Mitchell : What?
Claire : Mm-hmm. First you got all defensive of her, and then you tattled on
me to her. That's exactly what you did with old mom. It's what you're doing
with new mom.

Manny : You're gonna help me find it, or the next search will be for you.
Modern Family Season 3x08 page.4

Mitchell : Okay, okay.
Claire : Mm-hmm.

Driver : Come on, man! Move that truck!

Mitchell : Only you could make my friendship with Gloria into something
ugly.

Cameron : I hate you!

Claire : Don't get me wrong. I think it's sweet. We've all got our thing. You
have mommy issues.

Cameron : No! No help! I've come too far!

Mitchell : I do not have mommy issues!
Gloria : Okay. So I pick you up tomorrow, we go get you your big boy pants,
and then we go and get a little ice cream, okay?
Claire : Perfect.
Gloria : Hi. You still don't feel very good?
Jay : I told Phil I loved him. Oh. It was an accident. You know how he gets
with that stuff.
Gloria : Ay, I know.
Phil : Jay, can I talk to you later about what just happened?
Jay : Yeah.
Phil : Thanks. Jeez, I just worked that out.
Gloria : You're screwed.
Phil : Today is the biggest day of my life. Just relax. Let me know if I'm hurting
you.
Jay : Are you kidding me? It's fantastic. I love you. This! I love this!
Phil : Oh, my God. This is huge. Jay, I'm sorry. I need a minute.
Phil : The two guys who left the firm asked me to quit my job and partner
with them at the new agency. Big opportunity, big risk, and they need an
answer by the end of the day. I don't always make great decisions under
pressure.

Haley : Okay, so... I flirted with a table of truckers who have offered to help us.
Alex : Have you?
Cameron : Oh, hey! They don't sell pizzas at this restaurant! You parked here
illegally! Congratulations, sir. You're destroying America.
Haley ; Hey, there are no cars behind us. Go!
Alex : Gun it! Oh! Ow!
Cameron : All right! All right! Everybody relax! We're fine! We're fine!
Haley : We are not fine!
Alex : And we're all smooshed!
Haley : And we're scared!
Alex : And we're tilted at a 30-degree angle!
Haley : Nerd! And we're dirty and tired and late!
Cameron : Okay! Can you please just be quiet!
Haley : Why couldn't we have just asked for help?
Cameron : 'Cause I'm teaching you girls a very valuable lesson... that gay men
can do anything straight men can do.
Haley : Yeah, we know that. Do you think you're the only gay guy that we
know?
Alex : Yeah. My soccer coach is gay...
Haley : Our pediatrician...
Alex : My Latin tutor.
Haley : Nerd! Our electrician.
Cameron : Well, then why were you so surprised when I said I could drive a
truck?
Haley : Not because you're gay, because you're you.

Claire : What the hell is that?

Alex : And by the way, you can't.

Phil : An alpaca. I got the last one.
Modern Family Season 3x08 page.5

Cameron : Okay, wow. I guess I owe you an apology. I made a leap there. I'm
just used to dealing with stereotypes. I'm a little sensitive about it.

Abraham : Oh, my God, it's Alex Dunphy.

Haley : Oh! There's the trucker that I talked to. Hey! Excuse me! Hi! Could you
give us a hand, please?

Alex : Problem here, boys?

Boy : So awesome.

Trucker : Sure thing, sweetie.

Luke : These geeks won't give us back our helicopter that we took from
Reuben.

Cameron : Oh, like she'll be able to help us.

Alex : Is that right, Abraham?
Boy : Oh, my God. She knows your name.

Claire : Boy, do you have the right idea. Could use a little break from the
mother and child reunion going on down there. Don't ask. Mitchell's turning
Gloria into mom. Bam! It's out. Hmm. You remember the way mom and
Mitchell used to be in their private little club, just the two of them, and no one
else allowed in. Well... it's happening again, but this time around, it's
happening with your wife. You should see them down there. It would actually
be adorable if it weren't so sick. I just... you know, I feel like Mitchell is a
grown man, he has a child, and he's still working out some psychodrama from
20 years ago. Daddy, can I have a sip of your beer, please? Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. Mitchell cozies up to mom, I go running to daddy. I'm the one who's
turning Gloria into mom, which is really disturbing since we're the same age.
Jay : You're older.
Claire : Oh. Oh, that's where we're gonna chime in?
Luke : Will you hurry up?
Manny : I'm saving my strength because if we don't find this helicopter, I'm
walking to Canada.
Luke : Hope you like taxes.
Manny : Hey! That's our helicopter!
Abraham : Is it, now? I'm sure you have the proper documentation for that.

Alex : Helicopter, please.
Abraham : I love you.
Haley : What just happened?
Alex : You have your fans, I have mine. Some day, your fans are going to work
for my fans.
Claire : Oh, um, Gloria, do you mind if I talk to Mitchell alone for a minute?
Gloria : It's okay. I already know what you said, and I think it's crazy. Mitchell
is not making me his mommy.
Claire : No, I know. He's not, but I think that I might be.
Gloria : Okay, now you're going really, really crazy, because I am younger than
you.
Claire : Mm, by 14 months, so let's settle down.
Mitchell : What is going on with you today?
Claire : I... all right, I'm working this out as I go. I think maybe seeing you get
all buddy-buddy today with Gloria made me feel like it did when you were
with mom, and... and... I don't know. I-I felt like the odd man out.
Mitchell : Okay. Well, that... that's how I used to feel with you and dad.

Manny : You guys are bullies.

Claire : I know. I know. We... we chose teams, even during the divorce. It...
Okay, the last couple years, you and I have been our own team. You know?
And I don't want that to go away. So... I guess I just felt a little left out today.

Luke : They can't be bullies. They're nerds.

Mitchell : Shut up.

Abraham : Don't pigeonhole us. We can be both.

Gloria : Okay, can you two try hugging a box so that your poor mother doesn't
have to do all the hard work?

Luke : Just give it back. It's ours.

Cameron : Is there an issue here?
Alex : Uncle Cam, I got this.

Modern Family Season 3x08 page.6

Claire : I am sorry, Gloria, about all the mom stuff today. I just... I got this
crazy idea that you liked Mitchell better than me.

Phil : Thanks, Jay. Hey, look, I know you were reluctant to get that massage,
but I think we can both agree it had a happy ending.

Gloria : I do like Mitchell better than you.

Jay : Please don't say that.

Claire : What?
Gloria : Ay, please. Are you going to honestly tell me that I'm your favorite
person in this family? I'm not even your favorite Colombian in this family. I
would love to get closer to you. You have my number. But call me quickly
because I book up.
Jay : You never saw me.

Jay : If I could only save one possession in a fire, probably my first set of golf
clubs. My old man gave 'em to me.
Gloria : The engagement ring that Jay gave me that changed my life.
Mitchell : Lily's adoption papers.
Cameron : I was gonna say adoption papers. So I guess, then, I would say my
mom's recipe book.

Phil : There you are. I really need to talk to you.

Phil : All our family photos... Which I keep on my iPad, so my iPad.

Jay : You really don't.

Claire : As long as I have my family, I wouldn't need anything else. What?

Phil : Jay, please. It's about work. I got a text during your massage. I've been
offered a partnership in a new agency.

Phil : You say something like that, it makes us all seem petty.

Jay : Oh. Good for you!
Phil : I'm not so sure. I mean, there's... there's a big upside, but I have a stable
job right now. I have three kids, and at least one of them's going to college.
Worse case scenario, they all go.

Claire : Yeah. Well... I know.
Mitchell : Shh! Cam's sleeping. I don't wanna wake him.
Haley : He's had a rough day.

Jay : Well, what does Claire think?

Alex : Not as rough as grandpa's truck.

Phil : I haven't told her yet. I wanted to talk to you first. You've done this.

Mitchell : Shh! Thank you so much for driving me. I really didn't want to ride
in that big rig.

Jay : Well, I think that there's only really one question.
Phil : Whether I'm ready to run my own company?
Jay : Ah, you're great with people. We know you're a good salesman. You've
managed to provide a good living in tough times.
Phil : Then what? Is this the right time?
Jay : Never a perfect time. House could burn down tomorrow. Question is, do
you want this?
Phil : Yeah. Yeah, I really want it.
Jay : Then gamble on yourself. I'd gamble on you.
Phil : I'm gonna do it.
Jay : There you go!

Alex : It was amazing. Everybody was honking, and I learned, like, five new
curse words.
Haley : Mostly from Cam.
Cameron : Oh, I'm glad I could give you a laugh today. You know, I didn't
know that's what I was to you people a big joke.
Mitchell : No, honey, it wasn't like that.
Alex : No, we really didn't mean...
Haley : Uncle Cam, we love you.
Cameron : Save it. I'm going back to bed.
Haley : So he's still doing that?
Mitchell : Yeah. Yeah, but we're working on it.
Modern Family Season 3x08 page.7

3x09 : Punkin Chunkin
Kenneth : Ten years. Can you believe it?
Phil : Oh, my goodness, those hands are cold! At least buy me dinner first!

Claire : Mnh-mnh.

Luke : Boom!

Kenneth : I feel like we ended that last hug too soon. Come on again!

Claire : Tell my wife and kids I love them.

Claire : Oh, wow, that's a lot of hugging.

Phil : Oh, my God.

Phil : Oh! She's right. Why hug when you can... Man-shake.

Luke : That's kind of dark, mom.

Kenneth : Man-shake.

Claire : What?

Claire : I'm gonna get the coffee.

Phil : Wait, what's my favourite hospital food?
Claire : Ummm.

Claire : "Man-shake." Are we sure?

Phil : Jell-o! Hey buddy. No, today's still good.
Claire : Good for what? Who's buddy?

Phil : Roll up the curtain. Bing!

Phil : Yeah, just head on over the house.
Claire : Whose house? Who's buddy?

[OPENING CREDITS]

Phil : Ok, see you in a couple.
Claire : Couple of what? Who's buddy?
Phil : Kenneth.

Natalie : I don't know what's worse... that he competes every Thanksgiving in
a pie-eating contest, or that he's 9-time runner-up.

Claire : Kenneth?

Andy : It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without the contest.

Phil : Kenneth!

Natalie : Yes it would.
Cameron : I think I have to tell my punkin chunkin story.

Phil : If I had a son, I'd want him to be like Kenneth Ploufe.

Mitchell : Oh, no, no, you don't have to.

Claire : You do have a son.

Cameron : No, I kind of think I have to.

Phil : When we first moved in here, he was the sweet kid who lived next door.
Claire : Mm, the weird kid who lived next door, but Phil always had a soft
spot for him because Kenneth sort of looked up to him.

Mitchell : Once, Cam and his friends tried to slingshot a pumpkin across a
football field. Three seconds. That's all he needs to tell that story.

Phil : I wouldn't say hero.
Claire : And yet you did.
Phil : Well, you weren't going to. Claire's always had some issues with
Kenneth.
Claire : He would stare at me a little too long.

Cameron : So the fog was rolling in over the mountains like an ominous
blanket as we readied the giant slingshot. You know, Lorna, the pastor's
daughter, she was nervous because like I said, it was after curfew. She was a
goody two-shoe. Only pastor's daughter I ever met that was. So we finally
launch the pumpkin, and it sails through the air, goalpost to goalpost... past

Phil : Can you blame him? You used to dress sexy back then.
Modern Family Season 3x09 page.1

the end zone, into the parking lot, through the open roof of Lorna's dad's car. I
turn to Cody and I say, "now what are the chances of that landing there?" He
says, "where?" And I say... "The sunroof of a preacher man."
Mitchell : Wah-wah.
Manny : Okay, come on in! Voila!
Gloria : Ah!
Jay : Okay, what are we looking at?
Manny : My centerpiece for Thanksgiving.
Gloria : It is wonderful. You're so talented. I can't believe that you did this.
Manny : Yeah, my juices were really flowing on this one. I actually shot a
making-of video. Hey, maybe we can watch it later at the party.
Jay : Well, yeah, that or football.
Gloria : Mi amor, I'm so proud of you. Is there nothing in the world that you
can't do?

Kenneth : Ah! So many memories in this place.
Phil : Yeah.
Kenneth : Do you guys still have, like, every cereal?
Luke : We have a lot.
Kenneth : Yeah! Of course you do. Of course you do. You only have the
greatest dad in the world.
Phil : So what have you been up to? I haven't seen you since you went off to
college.
Kenneth : Oh, you know, actually, that didn't work out so well. I bounced
around for a while. Ended up washing dishes in New Mexico.
Claire : Mm, so without the benefit of a college degree, I guess your options
were kind of limited, huh?
Haley : Ease up. It's a holiday.

Jay : Centerpieces, for starters.

Kenneth : Yeah, it was... it was tough. Oh, no. No, thank you. Thank you,
though, sweetie. You're so sweet.

Gloria : Shh!

Claire : Oh. Okay.

Jay : Why do you say everything of his is great, even if it isn't?

Kenneth : It was tough for a while...

Gloria : Because I'm building him up. That's what parents do.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Jay : Too much, if you ask me. Kids cross the street nowadays, they get a
ribbon. Manny's got plenty of confidence. He just needs a little reality check
every now and then. And this thing is a horn of ugly.

Kenneth : But then a roommate and I started our own business.
Claire : Oh, was that also in the dish or cleaning industry?

Jay : I'm not getting that.

Kenneth : No. No, no, no. It was actually a small investment company. Well,
small at first. You know, we rode the tech wave for a while, then expanded into
video games, amusement parks, sports arenas. Anything that seemed
awesome, really. I'm actually in town to buy a blimp.

Gloria : Do not say a word to Manny.

Phil : Holy crow.

Jay : Fine. But trust me, if you told him the truth, he'd thank you later.

Haley : Ohh. Wow. So if you... if you'd gone to college, you would have done
all that just four years later, or... or never.

Gloria : Shh! My mother used to criticize everything I did. And look at me
now. I am a jumble of insecurities.

Gloria : Mm. Like Claire and Mitch? Did they thank you?
Jay : Not yet.
Gloria : Mm.
Jay : No. But it's coming.

Claire : Alex really needs to be picked up, sweetie. Why don't you go get her?
Haley : I wanna hear more of what he has to say about...
Claire : We're leaving.
Phil : Kenneth, I am so proud of you. You really made it.
Modern Family Season 3x09 page.2

Kenneth : Well, I did get one pretty lucky break. Early on, I met a very special
guy who taught me that what I thought and said had value.
Luke : Oh, you mean like...

Haley : All we have to do is keep it from mom until she goes to the store.
Then, when she sees it, she'll assume that it happened there, which it did, so
it's not really lying.

Phil : Shh. Luke. Let the man talk.

Alex : Listen to you. Are you gonna be a career criminal?

Kenneth : He encouraged me to always find the fun and follow this thing.

Haley : Ugh. You sound like mom. I don't know what I'm gonna do after High
School.

Claire : Your lung?
Kenneth : No, my heart. To this day, at every crossroad, I ask myself one
question... what would Phil Dunphy do?

Mitchell : It was a supportive "wah-wah." I was trying to save the moment.

Phil : Record scratch!

Cameron : There's no such thing as a supportive "wah-wah." A "wah-wah" by
its very nature is vicious and undercutting.

Kenneth : Oh, that's me buzzin'. Oh, it's Paris. She's my assistant in Tokyo.
You'd think they'd know how to demo 4-D gaming graphics without my help.
They don't. Hey, Luke, what instrument does yo-yo ma play? Um... cello?
Phil : He's me... And he's spectacular.
Alex : Oh, my God. Kenneth Ploufe is part owner of a resort in the Bahamas,
some cruise line, and Lacy Fair, that lingerie company.
Haley : Oh! Ew! I'm wearing one of his bras!
Alex : Look, he's got a model in his lap.
Haley : No way.
Alex : Look at her.
Haley : This is your fault!

Mitchell : Well, I was just trying to salvage that story, okay? I told you not to
tell it, you told it, and it died.
Cameron : It did not die. It's a thinker.
Mitchell : Cam, the only thing people were thinking was, "thank God this
story's over."
Cameron : Okay. I get it. So how long have I been embarrassing you with my
stories?
Mitchell : No, no, no, no. You don't embarrass me. I love your stories, okay?
The tractor in the swimming hole? Aunt Betty's wiglet on the piglet?
Cameron : Uncle Carl said she couldn't tell 'em apart.
Mitchell : See? Those are funny. You have so many great ones.

Alex : This is your fault!

Cameron : Well, that's farm life. Rain or shine, there's always a bumper crop of
stories.

Haley : Are you seriously gonna stay in here all day?

Mitchell : Yeah, I'm just saying maybe you take punkin chunkin out of the
rotation.

Alex : I can't face mom. If I see her, I'm gonna have to confess.

Cameron : I guess you're right. Maybe I could just...

Haley : Take a breather. It's just a dent. And saying nothing is not lying, okay?
It's just letting the truth speak for itself.

Mitchell : Yeah, stick to the ones that really happened, because people love
those.

Alex : This is not the time for moral equivocation.

Cameron : Excuse me. What?

Haley : Okay, I don't know what that means, and also, don't tell me.

Mitchell : I'm... I'm just saying people laugh more at stories that are true.

Alex : You're the one who's gonna lose her driving privileges. I don't know
why you're so calm.

Cameron : Punkin chunkin is a true story.
Mitchell : True-ish?
Modern Family Season 3x09 page.3

Cameron : No. True.

Jay : Hear him out.

Mitchell : Really? The length of a football field, through the sunroof of a car
that was open in late November in Missouri?

Manny : I just think if we bring it to Phil and Claire's, we'll never see it again,
right?

Cameron : It was unseasonably warm.

Jay : That's the plan.

Mitchell : That explains the fog rolling over the hill. And who's Cody... who
you're close enough to chunk with but mysteriously only appears in this
story?

Manny : Well, that would be sad. Except maybe my sadness will inspire me to
create something even greater. Remember that collage I made that helped us
get through Katrina?

Cameron : Cody was K.I.A. in Desert Storm. He's a hero. You know, all this
from someone who's never even chunked a punkin.

Gloria : Mm-hmm.

Mitchell : Well, I've never lunked a tunkin, either. You know, these aren't real
things.

Manny : So... is this the legendary rice pilaf we've been hearing about?

Phil : This'll work, right?

Manny : Not so much wrong as missing. It... it just tastes a little flat.

Luke : Totally, dad.

Jay : That a fact?

Phil : Why have one long table when you can use four little ones bistro style?
I'll bet this is how the French do Thanksgiving. You don't mind sitting with
your Uncle Mitch and, uh, grandpa, do you?

Manny : I just think with the earthiness of the rice, you might want something
zesty to set it off. I think this might be a job for cumin.

Luke : Anything's better than watching Lily chew.
Phil : By the way, this is the side of your old man that Kenneth was talking
about. Original. Imaginative. Fearless.
Luke : So Kenneth became a gajillionaire by asking himself, "what would Phil
do?"
Phil : He sure did. Where did that come from? Right?

Jay : You did this. You know that.
Jay : Try for yourself. Used to make it every year, but it, uh, started to upstage
the Turkey. Something wrong?

Jay : You know, since we're sharing helpful criticisms...
Gloria : No, no, no, no. Nobody's sharing anything. Manny, go change for the
party.
Jay : No, no, no, but I appreciate helpful criticisms. It, uh, it's important for me
that I hear the truth. Makes me stronger, less of a mama's boy.
Manny : Yeah, mom, he can take it.

Luke : But you're you. Why aren't we gajillionaires? Why don't you do what
Phil would do?

Gloria : That's what he says, but you don't really know what he feels
underneath. Some people are so sensitive, that they hear one criticism, and it
kills the spark that made them special.

Claire : Phil, why didn't you just put the extra leaves in the table?

Manny : I think I know what's going on here.

Phil : Trying to have some fun, be creative.

Jay : Good.

Claire : One long table, honey. If it was good enough for the last supper, it's
good enough for us.

Manny : This is about you and your mom, isn't it?

Manny : I'm having second thoughts about this centerpiece.
Gloria : Ay, no.

Gloria : Yes, it is.
Jay : No, it isn't.
Gloria : Yes, it is! Manny, don't upset me anymore. Go. Go change.
Manny : What... what should I wear?
Modern Family Season 3x09 page.4

Gloria : Ay, you look good in everything!

Phil : Claire, you always do this. You squelch me. You squelch me right when
I'm about to soar.

Alex : Where you going, mom?

Claire : Honey, you're folding napkins.

Claire : Mm, I gotta run to the store. Someone ate all the marshmallows.

Phil : You're folding my dreams! You know what Kenneth told me? The secret
to his success... his whole career, he's tried to emulate me. The only difference
is, he hasn't had someone constantly telling him what not to do.

Haley : Hey, can I tell you something? I was thinking that maybe after new
year's break, we could visit a couple more colleges.
Claire : Seriously?
Haley : I was so hard on you before. I'm sorry. I know I'm no Kenneth. I'm
gonna need all the help that I can get.
Claire : Honey, I am so proud of you. Oh. Oh, thank you.
Haley : Mm-hmm.
Claire : Oh, okay.
Haley : What are you doing?
Claire : Oh, Uncle Mitch is picking up the marshmallows.
Haley : Then again, backpacking through Europe could be educational in its
own way.

Claire : So the only reason we don't have a... a blimp tethered to our mailbox is
because I'm always shooting down your great ideas? Yeah. Let's review the
squelch pile, Phil. Let's see... the rice pudding franchise.
Phil : Works for all chewing abilities.
Claire : Adult tricycles.
Phil : Just try to fall off.
Claire : The aspirin gun.
Phil : Some people have a hard time swallowing! And you left one out.
Claire : Hmm.
Phil : And that, my dear Claire, is a real head-scratcher... "TM."

Claire : No! No, no! No, no, no! Do you know what's illegal in Europe?
Nothing! You are going to college!

Phil : Action. Hey, friend. You look like you had a rough day at the office.

Haley : Okay, fine.

Luke : The stress from my job at the robot assassin factory... It's too much to
take. Aw, shoot me an aspirin, pal.

Claire : Darn right it's fine.
Haley : Piece of cake.
Alex : My hair's coming out!

Phil : Maybe someday. But until then, try this on for size. The real headscratcher features 32 patent-pending "nogginizers" that gently massage your
scalp in a soothing purr of motorized delight.
Luke : Ahh. It feels great, and it looks good, too. It's a real lifesaver.

Claire : Wow, honey. I-I think you could make these simpler. Just, you know,
sort of do 'em flat and on the side.

Phil : You mean a real head-scratcher? "TM."

Phil : Hmm. Yeah. Seems like that's how you like me. Flat and on the side. You
know what? Sometimes I need to be puffed up and frilly.

Claire : I love you, Phil, but you...

Claire : All right, is this one of those moments I'm gonna have to remember
later when they ask me if there were any signs?
Phil : This is what Phil would do... make fantastic napkin origami that startles
and delights his guests.
Claire : I know, but, sweetie, they're just looking a little...

Phil : Stop. I love your "I love you." I'm getting awful tired of your "but." I
heard it.
Alex : Welcome, welcome, welcome! Happy Turkey day! Hey, is that a new
car?
Modern Family Season 3x09 page.5

Jay : Yep! It's the best, isn't it?

Gloria : He made a centerpiece!

Alex : I can't take my eyes off it. You shouldn't, either.

Phil : Oh, that's fantastic.

Gloria : Are you okay, mami?

Cameron : It's stunning.

Alex : I'm... I'm...

Manny : It's garbage.

Haley : Hey, guys! Now the party's started. Come on! How are you?

Gloria : No, no, no! What are you doing? It's so beautiful!

Gloria : Good.

Manny : Stop the lies. Jay told me the truth.

Alex : You disgust me.

Gloria : What did you say?

Haley : Are you hungry?

Jay : I mentioned it wasn't his best effort.

Manny : Oh, good. It's still in one piece. You hit those potholes pretty hard. It's
like you didn't see 'em.

Manny : He said it was a swing and a miss.

Jay : No, I saw 'em.
Manny : Can I be honest with you, Jay? I'm getting the sense that you're not
the biggest fan of "Allegria"?
Jay : You got a name for it now? Great. All right. Cards on the table? This is not
your best work. Now look, don't get me wrong. You're a talented kid. You're
gonna be a big success in the world. But this... this is a swing and a miss.

Gloria : Why?! Why do you say these things, Jay?! It's like I married my
mother!
Cameron : Jay, why would you do that?
Phil : Because he's a Pritchett. But don't let these negative nellies drag you
down, Manny, because one day you could have a trillion-dollar idea that the
people who supposedly love you most...
Claire : Okay, Phil! That's it. Go get the head-scratcher.

Manny : Well, but my mom said it was...

Phil : The real head-scratcher, "TM"?

Gloria : It's great, yeah, I know. But how did she say it?

Claire : Go get it, and let everybody else decide how many trillions I've cost
you.

Manny : What do you mean?
Jay : There's a big difference between "it's great," and "it's great." You hear
that? "It's great," and "it's greeeat."

Phil : Way ahead of you.

Manny : All I hear is a bunch of people telling me I'm great.

Manny : Yeah.

Phil : We are about to make hat history. Or as I like to call it, "hatstory." Early
man had hours and hours to scratch his weary head. But what about today's
busy times? Thank you, squire. Great thing about this? You can wear it
anywhere. Hit it, buddy. Oh! It's like a thousand tiny angels are line dancing
on my sca... I... it looks like we got a slight malfunction in a rear nogginizer.
Oh! Shut her down! Shut her down, buddy!

Jay : Of course you can. How you doing, honey?

Luke : It's not working!

Alex : I'm greeeat.

Phil : My hair! It's got my hair! Okay! Fine. That... I'm fine. Forgot about that
feature. It's an exfoliating... scrub. Buddy, can you grab the safety shears?

Jay : And that's a problem, because a lot of times people will lie to you to
protect your feelings, and that's not doing you any favors. You get a lot farther
in life if you know what you're good at and what you're not. Now you can
handle that, right?

Claire : Okay, everybody, come on! Two minutes till dinner! Get ready! Oh,
wow, Manny. What have you got there?

Mitchell : What's going on here?

Cameron : You know what, Phil? Keep it up. And I admire you and Manny. I
know what it's like to stare down skepticism from a loved one.
Modern Family Season 3x09 page.6

Mitchell : Cam, not now.

Manny : Hey, Cam, are you sure this is going to work?

Cameron : Why not now? It's Thanksgiving. Families gather. Issues come up.

Cameron : Oh, God, you sound just like Cody.

Jay : Only if you bring them up.

Luke : Do you think this could launch a human?

Cameron : It's healthy to get things out in the open. Y'all know my punkin
chunkin story, or do you need a refresher?

Phil : Luke... Let's do the pumpkin first.

Jay : We've heard it.

Jay : They're having fun over there, but you know it's gonna end in tears.

Claire : Oh, several times.

Mitchell : Yeah, always does.

Gloria : I love it. With Cody and the friends?

Claire : Knock-knock. Who's there? Physics.

Cameron : Yes. So you know how it ends. But the question is, who here thinks
I made that up?

Mitchell : Thank you.

Claire : Oh.
Cameron : Oh. Well, doesn't that tell the whole story right there? Here we have
the skeptics, the dream-squashers... The Pritchetts. And here we have the
dreamers, the artists, the visionaries.

Luke : Okay.

Claire : Mm-hmm.
Luke : Who's gonna be able to launch it?
Phil : I think it should be Cam!
Cameron : Oh, no! I think it should be all of us!

Phil : Sweet Caroline!

Gloria : All of us! All of us!

Jay : So we're supposed to believe that you make a... a pumpkin fly across a
football field.

Claire : For the record, I don't squash all of Phil's dreams, just the ones that
are, you know, potentially fatal.

Cameron : I can prove it to you right now. Let's go to the football field.

Jay : I'm just trying to get the kid ready for life.

Mitchell : Yes! Let's do this. I'd love to end this.

Mitchell : Yeah. Yes, i-if we didn't do this to them, the world would.

Phil : Yeah! Let's settle this! Dreamers versus Pritchetts!

Cameorn : Okay, everybody, in final launching positions?

Gloria : Bravo! Bravo!

Phil : Get ready to eat some crow!

Claire : No, no, no! Hold it! I did not just cook for eight hours so you people
could run off to prove some asinine point that's only gonna make half of us
feel bad! Come on! Show a little respect.

Gloria : It is not as delicious as it sounds. Okay... Uno! Dos! Tres! Three!

Jay : Turkey smells great, sweetheart.

Cameron : I don't know. I-I don't know.

Phil : Is that Turkey? Because something smells like chicken.

Luke : Can we do it again?

Claire : Okay, let's settle this.

Gloria : No, we only had one pumpkin, and we just chunk it.

Gloria : Yeah. Vamos, vamos! Jay, I drive!

Jay : Well, we were right.

Phil : Yeah!
Manny : What happened, Cam?

Claire : Aw, yeah. Ha!
Luke : This is the coolest thing ever.

Cameron : I'm sorry, guys.

Gloria : Okay, I want to film. Ay, no, wait, I want to be in it.

Claire : This usually feels a little better, doesn't it?
Modern Family Season 3x09 page.7

Mitchell : Yeah. All right. I-I hate to admit it, but when they put the pumpkin
in, I was kind of hoping it would work.
Jay : Yeah.

Cameron : You see, the dreamers need the realists to keep them from soaring
too close to the sun. And the realists... Well, without the dreamers, they might
not ever get off the ground.

Claire : Me, too.
Mitchell : Huh.

Mitchell : Okay! Next one's going through the... the goal thingy, I can feel it!

Cameron : All right! Let the gloating begin.
Jay : You know, it was a pretty good try.

Cameron : Now when Lorna, Cody, and I did this, it was...

Phil : We don't need your pity. Let's just get this stuff cleaned up.

Jay : Less talkin', more chunkin.

Mitchell : Well... or if... if maybe we, um... we launch it from a steeper angle?

Alex : Mom, I need to tell you something.

Claire : Yeah.

Claire : What is it, honey?

Jay : Then... maybe if you had somebody else you know, helping you pull the
thing.

Cameron : Ready!

Luke : But we don't have any more pumpkins.

Cameron : Fire!

Claire : That's the easy part! They're on every porch up and down the block.

Claire : Ohh!

Jay : Oh, we can handle that. Come on, kid!

Luke : Yeah!

Mitchell : Yeah.

Claire : Well, girls... three more seconds, and you would have gotten away
with it.

Phil : Come on. Let's try one.

Alex : I distracted Haley while she was driving, and we dented your car.

Alex : Mm.
Cameron : There are dreamers and there are realists in this world. You'd think
the dreamers would find the dreamers and the realists would find the realists,
but more often than not, the opposite is true.

Haley : Mm.
Luke : Now a human? Come here, Lily.
Phil : Luke, no.

Manny : Maybe if this works, we should launch my centerpiece next.
Jay : It wasn't that bad.
Manny : Your rice pilaf was.
Gloria : Jay, be careful!
Mitchell : Okay. All right.
Cameron : Oh! Oh! Keep going, keep going! Keep going!
Gloria : Ohh!

Modern Family Season 3x09 page.8

3x10 : Express Christmas

Gloria : Me.
Jay : No,you're not... Uh,maybe you are.

Gloria : Ay, finally!
Cameron : Look who's wearing her itsy bitsy bikini.

Phil : Actually, she's kind of at her best at Christmas. She makes a mean
cookie.

Phil : He can comment because he's raggay.

Claire : What other kind could she possibly make?

Claire : He was talking about Lily.

Gloria : Ay, it's so sad that you guys are not gonna be with your mom this
Christmas.

Phil : So was I.
Gloria : Ay, Cam, you make her look so pretty.
Mitchell : Guess who's not coming for Christmas.
Cameron : And the spotlight shifts.
Mitchell : Mom. She cancelled.
Claire : What?
Mitchell : In a voice mail, no less.
Claire : Unbelievable... and by that, I mean believable.

Mitchell : It's fine.
Claire : Yeah, it's more than fine. Let's just... Can we move off of mom?
Mitchell : Yes, please.
Cameron : Yeah, and the upside now, Mitchell... We can spend Christmas in
Missouri where it actually feels like Christmas.
Claire : Wait. Hang on a second. Just because mom isn't coming doesn't mean
we're not gonna spend Christmas together. I mean, it's about family.

Haley : Why isn't Nana coming?

Cameron : Who do you think we're seeing in Missouri, Claire, the oak ridge
boys?

Mitchell : I don't know. Something about her new boyfriend whisking her
away on a cruise.

Jay : Hold on. I thought we were all getting together Christmas eve this year.
We're on a flight to Mexico the 25th.

Jay : I just got my gift.

Claire : What do you mean, you're getting on a flight on the 25th?

Claire : What boyfriend?
Alex : Carl the cruise ship captain. It was in her holiday newsletter.

Jay : You two needed time with your mom. I've already served my time with
your mom.

Claire : Oh, I can't read that whole thing. No.

Claire : Oh, dad.

Cameron : Yeah, after two pages about the bird she rescued...

Mitchell : Well, uh, well, when are we gonna have Christmas then?

Phil : And by the way, I don't think you can say you rescued something if it
dies.

Luke : I heard kids are getting snatched in Mexico.

Cameron : It died?

Gloria : Kids get snatched here just as much. It happens all the time. Don't be
scared.

Jay : She wrote a poem about it.
Manny : A little too free with the free verse for my taste, but fine, we'll call it a
poem.
Mitchell : I stopped reading after she talked about suing her book club.
Claire : Oh, I stopped reading after "dear friends,family and others... " I'm
sorry. Who are "others"?

Manny : What?

Manny : Now when you say "all the time"...
Mitchell : okay, well what about next weekend? 'Cause we don't leave till the
21st, right?
Claire : Yeah, we leave tomorrow and we don't come back until the 21st.
Haley : Hey, math club, could you get me some more lemonade?
Modern Family Season 3x10 page.1

Claire : Are we saying that this is the last time we're all gonna be together as a
family until after the holidays?

Mitchell : Oh! I will. I will. Because, you know, get the wrong kind, people get
upset.

Luke : And for you, maybe ever.

Claire : You get upset.

Mitchell : Well, this stinks.

Mitchell : I'm people.

Cameron : Yeah, we can't do this. This is not right.

Phil : Fine, I'll get the turkey. What about gifts?

Claire : We always spend Christmas together.

Gloria : Jay, did we finish shopping?

Mitchell : Yeah, we have to do something about it.

Jay : Yeah, but we're not wrapped.

Phil : Ho, ho, hold up a sec. We're all free today. We've got four hours to shop,
cook, wrap, get a tree. By tonight, we could be celebrating Christmas, right?

Cameron : Oh, I can help with that. We have a mobile wrapping station. God,
has that thing paid for itself.

Mitchell : I... I guess we could do that.

Mitchell : Really? 'cause I feel like I paid for it.

Phil : Of course we can! Have you ever heard of express Christmas? No. No,
you haven't, because I just invented it. Express Christmas, "tm." It's when you
can't have it on Christmas day...

Phil : Okay. We've got lights and ornaments at our place.

Cameron : I got it.
Phil : And you have to scramble.
Jay : Get on with it!
Phil : We're wasting time! We're wasting time! Everyone in the house! We'll
make a plan! Time is of the-oh! Ow! Hot! Hot! It's just too hot!
Claire : Oh, Phil!
[OPENING CREDITS]
Jay : So we're really doing this, huh?
Mitchell : Yes.
Jay : 'Cause I had stuff lined up for Christmas eve.

Mitchell : Oh! You know what would be great? It's the angel!
Claire : The angel. Yeah. Where is it?
Mitchell : Oh. Um, Gloria, it's up in your attic. Would you get it?
Gloria : Ay, no! Not the attic! It's dirty, and there are spiders.
Mitchell : Oh, but it really won't be Christmas without it.
Jay : Won't be Christmas with it. It's December 16th.
Phil : Luke will help Gloria. He's not scared.
Manny : Oh, good. You won't find me in any attic.
Luke : That may be exactly where they find you.
Manny : Mom!
Haley : Uh, I have a party tonight. You promised I could go if I got a "b" on my
test. I studied. I read stuff. What was the point of all that?
Claire : The point, young lady, is for...

Gloria : Yeah, Jay. It's Manny's last chance to enjoy a family Christmas.

Phil : Who can remember? Express Christmas will be done by 9:00. Claire, I'll
text you the gift list.

Manny : Until next year, you mean.

Claire : Okay.

Luke : Well, with all the snatchings...

Phil : You and Haley do the shopping. Manny, you're coming with me. We're
gonna get groceries. Dinner, our house, 6:00. Let's move! On dasher! On
dancer! On prancer and vixen! Hey, that kind of worked out.

Manny : Get out of my head, Luke!
Phil : Okay, who's gonna get the tree?

Claire : Come on, Haley. It'll be fun. A lot of fun. We can go to target. Okay?
Modern Family Season 3x10 page.2

Phil : Come on, let's go!
Mitchell : So it's-it's just me and Lily getting the tree, then? Hello?
Lily : Hello?
Alex : My mom tells me it's "xmas" in a text?
Mitchell : Yeah, well, my mom canceled in a voice mail and told me she had a
boyfriend in a newsletter, so... Join the team. Put some clothes on. We're
getting a tree. Wait. Hold on.

Claire : Listen to me. Your whole life has led to this moment. All the training,
the hours of dedication... There's not a soul alive who can touch you when it
comes to shopping, and, baby, you know it. Look at me. Be you.
Haley : Give me that list.
Claire : Never been more proud in my life. Come on.
Haley : No. This way.
Alex : What about this one?

Gloria : Luke!
Luke : At what?
Gloria : What do you mean, "at what"? I said "Luke."
Luke : I am looking.
Gloria : I know you are. Stay on the beams. Maybe it's here. Ay, dios mio! El
Diablo! It's back! What is so special about that angel, anyways?
Luke : I don't know. I guess nana made it for mom and uncle Mitchell when
they were kids.

Mitchell : Let's see. No. No. I'm sorry, I know I'm being really o.c.d. Right now,
but there's something very particular that I'm looking for. It needs to be a
douglas fir, at least 8 feet tall, and look good from all sides.
Alex : Exactly. No bald spots.
Mitchell : Yes. Thank you. Thank you. The key is symmetry, right? How come
we never go shopping together?
Alex : Because I hate shopping.
Mitchell : I do, too! Okay, this one.

Gloria : Ay, that's nice. Look where you're going!

Alex : Wait. Oh. No, no, no.

Luke : To open more boxes. oh, you said "look where you're going," didn't
you?

Mitchell : Oh, no, no, no, no.

Gloria : Yes.
Luke : Every time you say "Luke," I think you're saying "look."
Gloria : I don't hear the difference.
Luke : It's not that hard. One is my name.
Gloria : Juan is not your name! Stop kidding around and look, Luke. Ay, I get
it. "look" sounds like "Luke."

Salesman : Uh, I think I know what you're looking for, and we just got a
shipment that might be perfect for you.
Alex : Okay, wow. Just because my uncle is clearly gay... doesn't mean he'd
ever want your tacky pink tree. And frankly, we'd rather throw some lights on
a coatrack than have to deal with knuckle-draggers like you today of all days.
December 16th.
Mitchell : Okay, first of all, amazing. Second of all...

Luke : Yes. Thank god. I've been carrying that one around for three years.

Salesman : I was pointing to the truck. It's full of 8- foot douglas-firs. It's
behind the pink tree.

Haley : Ugh. There's like a hundred things on this list.

Mitchell : Second of all, uh, we're-we're gonna go ahead and take, uh, this-this
tree...

Claire : I know but it's just the two of us. It's fun.

Alex : That one.

Haley : Okay, it's not fake mother's day. Ugh! This place is huge! oh, plus we
have to cook dinner! This is impossible.

Mitchell : And we're going to tie it onto our car ourselves.
Salesman : You bet you will.
Modern Family Season 3x10 page.3

Lily : I have two daddies.

Cameron : Oh. Finger.

Cameron : No, I do this. This is my fault. I... I attach too much meaning to
things. I mean, we watched our first football game together five years ago, and
I feel the need to save the cork from the bottle of wine you served. I mean,
who does that? It's not your only gift, by the way. There's a duplicate bottle in
that box right over there which I had engraved with the date and the final
score, because I have a problem. I feel too much. I gotta get going to Claire's.

Jay : All right.

Jay : Cam...

Cameron : Cam and Jay-you know, sort of sounds like a bird. "the migratory
patterns of the Cam and Jay... "

Cameron : No. Fresh wound. Can't talk yet.

Jay : Do you have any more tape in that thing?

Cameron : Let it scab, Jay. Let it scab.

Mitchell : He gets it, Lily.
Alex : Yeah.

Cameron : Do I have more tape in that? I got a tank full of tape, mister. What
do you want? Invisible? Satin finish? Uh, double sided?
Jay : Whatever. Whatever.

Jay : Fine. We'll put a cork in it.

Haley : Oh, there you are. I thought I'd lost you.

Cameron : Okay. That's interesting.

Claire : Oh, I'm sorry. I may have taken a few minutes to try out a futon. It's a
young woman's game. Okay. Where do we stand?

Jay : I doubt that it is,but what?

Haley : I think we have everything.

Cameron : Well, I mean the way you wrap a gift. That's a lot of tape. Nobody
can get in. Kind of like... You know... I mean, well, you let me in, but in
general,w... Why so much tape, Jay?

Claire : Yes!

Jay : Why are you wearing a sweater when it's 95 degrees out?
Cameron : It's my Christmas sweater.
Jay : Based on those stains, you are the Christmas sweater.
Cameron : Well, who's been a very good boy? So... Okay. Are we gonna talk
about the elephant in the room, which is ironic because it's so tiny?
Jay : A man doesn't give another man a gift this small.
Cameron : Oh, what do you think it is, a ring?
Jay : Was there wine with this cork?
Cameron : Yes, there was, and we drank it on...

Haley : Oh... Except the ladybug night-light for Lily.
Claire : Haley, your whole life has led up...
Haley : Oh, I got it, mom, I got it.
Claire : Okay, okay, I'll b... I'll see you in line.
Man : Yes, Ronald? I not only found it, I got the last one. Yes, the ladybug, not
the turtle. I also got the doll, so I'm all set. I'm gonna leave in five.
Claire : Or maybe I just want paper. Paper. Paper. Just paper all the way. Yeah!
Haley! Too late to change my mind?

Jay : Oh, we drank it on, uh... eh? Yeah. Um... On that boat.

Haley : Sir, would you like me to hold your merchandise up at the register
while you finish shopping?

Cameron : You have no idea.

Man : Oh. Aren't you a dream?

Jay : I can't even remember my own anniversary, Cam. How would I have
remembered having had wine with my son's boyfriend?

Claire : Pack of gum. And... One more pack of gum. People drop in this time
of year, you know.
Modern Family Season 3x10 page.4

Haley : Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me. Sorry. Excuse me. Night-light you were
looking for, ma'am. Ring her up, Madison.

Manny : My mom keeps a stun gun for emergencies.

Claire : Thank you. There you go.

Manny : I thought he was going to snatch me.

Phil : This isn't an emergen... Eeh! Now it is.
Phil : A butterball is a turkey.

Manny : You're leaving me alone here?

Manny : What'd he say?

Phil : No, no, no, no. I... It'll, uh, it'll just take me two minutes. I need to get
Jay's super secret special gift.

Man : I think he said, "a butterball's a turkey." I was reaching for the turkey.

Manny : Great. First you lose me in the grocery store, now I'm in a deserted
parking lot. Why don't you just put a sign on me that says "free kid"?
Phil : I think that might be him.
Manny : You don't know the guy we're meeting?
Phil : That's how craigslist works. Total strangers sell you things like signed
vintage baseball cards that make your father-in-law respect you for an
afternoon.

Manny : Oh. Well, we can't give you our turkey.
Phil : Yes, we can. And... Here's the... Money. Joe Dimaggio. Joe Dimaggio.
Mint condit... Near-mint con... Fair condit... Garbage.
Luke : Huh. Never saw this before. "an angel for my angels. Love, mom."
Gloria : Oh, that's beautiful.
Luke : And it smells like mothballs, just like nana.

Manny : I don't like the looks of this guy.

Gloria : Luke...

Phil : He looks like everybody else.

Mitchell : Thank-merry Christmas...

Manny : Great. You can just tell that to the police sketch artist.

Alex : Just... just give it up. He hates us.

Man : Joe Dimaggio?

Mitchell : Don't beat yourself up. I do that, like, once a week. The good news
is, we never have to come back here.

Phil : Phil Dunphy, but I get that a lot. Kidding. I'm your guy.
Man : Can I see the cash?
Phil : Yes. Can I... Can I see the card? Mint condition.
Man : That's why I want another $50.
Phil : I only have the $200.
Man : Uh, deal's off, then.
Phil : Come on. It's Christmas... At our house. It's a long story.
Man : $225.
Phil : I just spent all my cash on groceries.
Man : Fine. But I'm taking the butterball.
Phil : I don't know about that.
Manny : That's it. I'm getting mother's little helper.
Phil : What?

Alex : Watch out! The tree!
Mitchell : I can't watch!
Luke : Look!
Gloria : Ay, yes, I said "Luke." You told me already. I did it right!
Luke : No! Look!
Gloria : Never look back. Never!
Alex : Maybe we can salvage it?
Gloria : Are you okay, papi?
Luke : Yeah.
Gloria : Good. That's because we had our guardian angel. Ay! A spider!
Haley : Hey, mom? Check it.
Claire : The gum! Oh, and you made it pretty. Honey, put it on the table.
Modern Family Season 3x10 page.5

Haley : New tradition?

Claire : There's no turkey? What's the plan, Phil?

Claire : Oh, yes. Yes.
Gloria : Hmmm, Christmas gum. I take one.

Phil : Cornish game hens. If you get real close, they look like turkeys, and
everyone gets their own.

Jay : Tough to decorate the tree with no tree, huh?

Jay : Sounds like fun.

Cameron : Yeah.

Claire : Not fun. Not fun. I asked you to pick up a cooked turkey.

Jay : How long you gonna ignore me, Cam?

Phil : The store was out of turkeys. It was an hour to express Christmas.
Please, just make it work, okay? Please.

Cameron : Until the shame cloud clears. You know, I push. I'm a pusher.
Jay : You gotta give yourself a break. See, the thing about me, I'm not as open
with feelings as you. You've gotta lower your expectations.

Claire : They're not even defrosted.
Phil : Fine, Claire. You want 'em defrosted? Merry... Freaking... Christmas!

Cameron : Oh, I get it. Baby steps.

Claire : Phil!

Jay : No steps. This is it.

Gloria : Is that my stun gun?

Cameron : See? Did it again. Push! Push, push, push, push. Now I've pushed
you out of the room. That's fine.

Phil : Yep. And it works great.

Gloria : How is she?

Claire : Okay. Okay. Um... We can make this work. This can work. Dad, you
and Mitchell reassemble that tree.

Luke : I got the tire marks off her wings, but I can't get her head to stay on.

Jay : All right.

Gloria : Okay, that's what this is for. Now stick it in the top of the tree with the
good part facing out. Come on.

Claire : And I am going to defrost these birds, and we'll cook them in shifts,
and we'll just push dinner back by a bit.

Jay : Well, that stuffing looks good. All we need now is a turkey to surround it.

Haley : Oh, how long? 'cause I still have my party.

Claire : Well, relax. Phil just texted, and he's "on his wax."

Jay : What the hell happened to the angel?

Mitchell : Okay! Here comes the tree.

Gloria : No! The real question here is, how come we still have the dog butler?

Jay : Oh! Finally!

Jay : Oh, you found him, huh?

Alex : Here comes more of the tree.

Mitchell : Well, this thing is... It's filthy. And... What happened?!

Jay : Hi, honey.

Gloria : It got run over.

Cameron : Oh. Oh, my gosh. What happened?

Luke : Probably by the same maniac who ran over the tree.

Mitchell : Well, uh, someone ran over it, but that's okay 'cause we are gonna
put it back together.

Mitchell : Oh, my god. Is that... Yep. Yep, that's gum. That is gum. Okay, I'm...
I'm out. I'm done. I am out. No. No turkey, no tree, and now this looks like the
lady she used to be before she died and became an angel.

Alex : Right now.
Gloria : He's gonna need a lot of gum.
Claire : Oh, thank god. Here comes Phil and the butterball.
Alex : I have a name.
Phil : I am sorry, but there is no turkey.

Claire : All right. Relax, Mitchell. It's an ornament.
Haley : No, he's right. We're never gonna get this together. I'm going to my
party.
Claire : No, no. No, you're not. You are not. You're staying right here, because
you're not going to abandon your family...On Christmas.
Modern Family Season 3x10 page.6

Haley : It's not Christmas.

Jay : Not bad, huh?

Mitchell : Exactly. Exactly. It's not Christmas, Claire.

Cameron : Jay, Jay, Jay.

Claire : Okay, fine! Fine! You know what? I am really tired of trying to make
this work on my own. I will see you people in a year.

Jay : You wanna hug me, don't you?

Alex : And nine days.

Jay : 4 to 5 seconds.

Gloria : No! Nobody goes anywhere. I know what the problem is here. You
two miss your mommy.

Cameron : 45 seconds?

Mitchell : No.
Claire : I do not miss my mommy.
Gloria : Admit it. It's sad. She used to make you cookies, the angel... Now she
talks to you in a newsletter and she cancels for no reason. Come here, my little
ones.
Mitchell : No. We're... Good. No, it's fine.
Claire : We're good. It's not a big deal.
Gloria : It's Christmas. You need a mommy.
Mitchell : You're not mommy.
Gloria : And it's not Christmas. Come here. It's okay to miss her.
Jay : Can I put in my 2 cents on fake Christmas?
Phil : Express Christmas.
Jay : Let it go, Phil. It's not sticking.
Phil : It needs time.
Jay : We all gave it our best shot to make this thing work. It just didn't happen,
all right? What do you say we cut our losses? Let's go out to a nice Chinese
restaurant and have a traditional Jewish Christmas.
Manny : But I risked my life grocery shopping.
Jay : Save that story for wang fu. Now let's go. Come on, everybody.
Mitchell : Dad, no.
Jay : On me! Out! Everybody out! Let's go. Come on, baby girl. Come on,
honey.
Luke : What's going on?
Claire : You hate Chinese food.

Cameron : I kind of do.

Jay : 4 to 5 seconds.
Cameron : Oh, okay.
Gloria : Family is family. Whether it's the one you start out with...
Mitchell : Hi, mom!
Claire : Hi, mom!
Mitchell : Merry Christmas! So, um, tell us everything about the new
boyfriend.
Claire : Oh, yeah.
Mitchell : Don't leave anything out.
Claire : You can leave some things out.
Gloria : The one that you end up with... Or the family that you gain along the
way... Which makes every day december 16th.
Phil : Hey, Jay, um, I'm sorry about the baseball card. I- I did get you a- a
backup gift. It's-it's nothing. I picked it up when we stopped for gas.
Jay : Dog antlers.
Phil : I know. You got us snow, and I got you dog antlers.
Jay : I love these.
Phil : I thought you might.
Jay : Honey, look. Come here. How cute is that? Where's my camera? Gloria,
you gotta see this! Casta, Gloria!
Phil : Dog antlers...
Cameron : He loves dog antlers.
Phil : Oh, no! Okay! I am so sorry.

3x11 : Lifetime Supply
Dr. Sendroff : So how's the family?
Phil : Great. Kids are getting so big. Haley's about to go off...
Dr. Sendroff : You can stop holding your stomach in.
Phil : ...to college.
Dr. Sendroff : You still exercising?
Phil : Clearly. I look at Clint Eastwood or Chuck Norris and I think, there's no
reason I can't stay tough like.. Oh, tickles! But... Aw!
Dr. Sendroff : That hurt?
Phil : No. Not r... ow. What?
Dr. Sendroff : It's probably nothing. You feeling okay?

Alex : "California State Bar Association Award, for Distinguished Service in
The Field of Environmental Law."
Cameron : You should have seen it. They called his name, he went up on
stage, he gave a great speech. It was humble, inspirational, with a touch of dry
humor at the end. It was very Colin Firth.
Mitchell : Oh, Cam, thank you, But... it's hardly an Oscar.
Mitchell : In the environmental law community, it kinda is an Oscar.
Cameron : So how was Lily? I hope you weren't too bored.
Alex : Oh, please, are you kidding me? I love talking to her. She knows more
words than Haley.

Phil : Yeah.

Cameron : Oh, that looks great up there! How impressed are you with your
uncle right now?

Dr. Sendroff : Maybe we'll just run a couple of tests, just to be safe.

Alex : So impressed.

Phil : What kind of tests?
Dr. Sendroff : If there's anything wrong, I'll give you a call.
Phil : Okay.

Alex : I didn't wanna ruin their moment by telling them how many awards
I've gotten, but let's just say I don't get out of bed for a trophy that size.

Dr. Sendroff : So how's the real estate market doing?
Phil : Well, interest rates are low, so it's a great time to be a buyer, but if you're
a seller, you really have to...

Jay : Darn it! I'm trying to send an e-mail. This mouse keeps sticking. Pretty
big reaction. It's 10 bucks, tops.

Dr. Sendroff : Bend over?
Dr. Sendroff : No, no, no. I need you to bend over.

Gloria : You just reminded me about my dream last night. I was in the middle
of a meadow, coming down a staircase, then suddenly a black mouse showed
up. He stopped, stared at me in the eyes, and opened his little mouth.

Phil : Oh. Right. Well, let's dim the lights, crank up the Norah Jones, and get
this over with.

Gloria : What did he say, Jay? He was a mouse. They don't know how to talk.

Phil : True, but a quality property is still a quality...

Alex : Oh, hey. How'd it go?
Cameron : Amazing. I was so proud of him.
Mitchell : Oh, thanks, honey. I'm kind of proud of me, too. Look at what they
gave me.

Jay : What did it say?
Jay : Now you're playing logic police? You're standing on a staircase in a
meadow?
Gloria : In my country, when somebody dreams about a black mouse, it means
that something bad is going to happen!
Jay : Ah, don't worry about it. I dreamt about a lucky blue cow. We're good to
go.
Modern Family Season 3x11 page.1

Manny : Hey, Jay, this is what I'm wearing for golfing tomorrow. Wanted to
give you a heads up in case there's some overlap.

Jay : But I was looking forward to playing...

Jay : What are you going for here?

Gloria : You're going.

Manny : Matt Damon in "Bagger Vance." You didn't get that?

Javier : That I don't miss.

Gloria : I did. I think you look just like him.
Manny : It's the whole reason I asked you to teach me to golf. Any sport where
you can wear this, I'm in.
Gloria : Who is that? It's 10:00 at night.
Manny : I'll get it.
Jay : Hold on, Gatsby.
Javier : Hola! It's Javier! Open up!
Manny : Dad!
Javier : There's my campeón!
Jay : There's your black mouse.
Gloria : Hola, Javier, what are you doing in town?
Javier : Well, I missed Manny's birthday, plus I have a free week.
Jay : You're staying a week? Make that go away.
Javier : So, Manny, tomorrow, in honor of you becoming a man. I am taking
you to the racetrack to enjoy the sport of kings, hmm?
Manny : That's so cool!
Jay : Actually, Manny and I have plans to play golf tomorrow.
Javier : Golfing? Pfft! That is for old men and for women who like women.
Come on. Your dad is in town. Let's go to the races.

[OPENING CREDITS]
Mitchell : Would you look at that?
Cameron : Oh, yeah, you know, I never saw us as trophy on the mantle
people, but yours looked so gosh darned good up there, I figured, why not be
proud of what we've done?
Mitchell : Uh, "First Place, Bass Catchers Spring Fish-Off, Missouri North
Division."
Cameron : 2-day total of 10 smallmouth bass weighing 34.24 pounds with a 4
1/2-pound kicker.
Mitchell : So you beat all the other boys aged 12 through 17?
Cameron : Sure did. Look at our trophies up there. We're a couple of winners,
aren't we?
Mitchell : Are we?
Phil : Claire? Where are all my razor blades?
Claire : They're not in that box?

Manny : Yeah, can we all go?

Phil : No.

Gloria : Ay, no, baby, I can't. I promised Haley that I was gonna help her with
her Spanish. But Jay's going to go with you.

Claire : Well, I guess they're gone.
Phil : They can't be gone.

Jay : What?
Gloria : I'm not gonna let Manny take off with Javier by himself. Once, when
Manny was 6, Javier took him to the petting zoo, which later, I found out that
was the name of the stripper club. A real petting zoo would have been cleaner.

Phil : In my 20s, I went on a game show and won a lifetime supply of razor
blades.
Chip : Okay, Phil, time is up. What is your answer?
Modern Family Season 3x11 page.2

Phil : 3.14159.
Chip : Oh! I'm sorry, Phil. The correct answer is banana cream. Banana cream.

Claire : Maybe Luke hit you with his broomstick when you guys were playing
Quidditch.

Phil : Banana cream. Well, you got me there, Chip.

Phil : I'm way too fast, he never touched me.

Chip : But you're not leaving empty-handed, no. You're going home with a
lifetime supply of Genesis twin-blade razors.

Claire : I can assure you you are perfectly fine.

Phil : What?! Two blades in one razor? Man, it'll never get better than that!
Claire : You must have used them all up.
Phil : They said "a lifetime supply."
Claire : Honey, you got 15 years of free razor blades. Put that in the "Win"
column and move on.
Luke : Mom, is it okay if my friend Walt comes over to play "Rebel Fighters 3"?
Claire : Honey, don't you think it is a little weird that one of your best friends
is an eighty-year-old man?
Luke : No, it makes it more fun, because he was in a real war. He says cool
things like "See you in hell, Klaus." I don't even know what that means. Oh,
hey, dad, some doctor called for you.

Phil : That's very comforting, coming from a marketing major at a party
school.
Jay : I like the number 4 horse. He loves this track, his dad won the Preakness,
last three finishes were in the money.
Manny : I like Miranda's Miracle.
Jay : Why?
Manny : There's this girl Miranda in my class, and she is really pretty. If she
likes me back, it will be a miracle. Would you bet $2 on that one for me, Jay?
Jay : Sure, but you are throwing your money away.
Javier : You both are. The winner of the race will be number 7... my hometown.
Jay : Number 7... Well, he's carrying 3 extra pounds, and he hates the distance.

Phil : Dr. Sendroff?

Javier : Those are just words on a page. I look the horse in the eye, and he tells
me... he is the winner.

Luke : Yeah, that's it. You were in the shower.

Jay : Tells ya?

Phil : What did he say?

Javier : Perhaps this will sound crazy.

Luke : He wants you to call him right away. Oh, well. See you in hell, Klaus.

Jay : No need for the qualifier.

Claire : What's wrong?

Javier : But I have always been able to see into the soul of a horse. It is a gift,
and I do not question it. Just like I always end up on the shortest line at the
bank.

Phil : I don't know. He ran a few tests on me yesterday. He said he'll call if
something was wrong. And now he's calling. Hi, this is Phil Dunphy. I'm
returning Dr. Sendroff's call. Are you serious?
Claire : What?
Phil : He's on a flight to London. Um, is there any way I can reach him, or...uh,
uh, someone else I can talk to? Okay. Fine. Please just tell him it's urgent.
Thank you. Oh, boy.

Manny : Maybe I should bet on your horse.
Jay : Are you kidding me? These aren't just words. They give you all this
information, so you can make an informed decision and beat the odds.
Javier : Yes, of course, and this is why everybody with a racing form is rich.
Now come on. It's time to place our bets. What's it gonna be, Manny?

Claire : Honey, I am sure it's nothing.

Manny : $2 on my hometown. You really think he's going to win?

Phil : Claire, I'm tender under my arm.

Javier : Well, I only know what he tells me with his eyes. Don't ask me why,
but maybe in some previous life, I was a horse.
Modern Family Season 3x11 page.3

Jay : Or part of a horse.

Gloria : Hola, Haley.
Haley : Hi, Gloria. Thanks for coming over.

Cameron : Oh, hey, Alex called. She left her cell phone here. She's gonna come
back and get it.

Gloria : En español, por favor.

Mitchell : Cam, did you do something to your fish trophy?

Gloria : No, the whole thing.

Cameron : Oh, yeah, I forgot about this fun middle part. You see, now it looks
like a fish jumping out of the water.

Haley : I don't know the whole thing. Why do I even need to learn Spanish? I
live in california. I'm never gonna use it.

Mitchell : Yeah, right over mine.

Gloria : That's the problem with Americans. They expect all of us to know
their language, but they don't even make the effort to learn ours.

Cameron : Do I sense something, Mitch? You know, just because mine's a little
taller than yours, doesn't make yours any less important.

Haley : Uh, hola, Gloria. Gracias for coming over.

Walt : Win a war sometime. Then we'll start talking like you.

Mitchell : Oh, no. That's not what I was feeling, not even a little bit.

Luke : Ha. So wrong.

Cameron : Oh, my god. You don't like that I put my trophy up.

Phil : Oh, hey, Gloria.

Mitchell : I just think it's a little weird that immediately after I win a trophy,
You feel the need to dig this thing up and plop it down next to mine.

Gloria : Hi, Phil. How are you?

Cameron : I'll have you know that I want to display this for quite some time.
But I put it in box in the garage with all my other awards... Yes, award-z... Out
of courtesy to a sadly award-less you.
Mitchell : It looks ridiculous. Mine is a distinguished professional award
given to me by my peers, and yours was given to you on a pier.

Phil : I wish I knew.
Gloria : Why? What's wrong?
Phil : Uh, I don't wanna bum you out. My doctor did some tests and said he'd
call if something was wrong, and he called this morning.
Gloria : And what did he say?

Cameron : Okay, well, for your information, when I won this, it was a very big
deal. I cut a ribbon at the grocery store and signed autographs. "Best fishes,
Cameron Tucker"

Phil : I don't know. I missed the call. Now I can't reach him.

Mitchell : Oh, you know what? I just remembered! Mine comes with a really
fun pedestal, too! Oh! Look at that! Oh, and proper hierarchy is restored.
Unless you suddenly remember that your fish came with a top hat.

Gloria : In my dream. It was a bad omen. But probably not for you. The
staircase. No, no, no. You're fine. You're fine.

Cameron : Okay. Well, you know what? I'm gonna go get Lily from her party
and go to the park.
Mitchell : OK.
Cameron : This award has changed you, Mitchell. You may be flying high
now, but pretty soon, you're gonna be free falling, Tom Petty... Because you're
petty. Tom Petty. Hmm? Get it?
Mitchell : About three sentences ago.

Gloria : The black mouse.
Phil : What?

Phil : Am I? Get this... 15 years ago, I won a lifetime supply of razor blades.
They ran out... today. What's with the spitting? Are you warding off death?
Gloria : No. When I did I think I suck in a little bug.
Manny : $16 for the first race, $10 from the second race, plus $34... $60? You're
a genius, dad.
Javier : Well, I cannot take all the credit. It is a particularly chatty group of
horses today.
Modern Family Season 3x11 page.4

Manny : I love gambling! It's so easy!

Mitchell : Your, uh, phone's on the table.

Jay : It's not easy.

Alex : What's that?

Javier : Well, not for you. You've lost, what, three in a row?
Manny : Oh, burn, Jay! I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. This is all so heady.

Mitchell : Oh, Cam's old fishing trophy. Yeah, when I woke up this morning,
that's where I found it.

Jay : $50 on little bacon to win.

Alex : Right after you got yours?

Javier : Ooh-ee.

Mitchell : Thank you!

Manny : Yeah, ooh-ee.

Alex : Oh, my god. Welcome to my world. Last week, I got this beautiful
plaque from the debate team for outstanding achievement, and what did my
mom do? She found one of Luke's "participant" ribbons and a certificate Haley
got for showing up somewhere on time, and put all three of them together on
the same shelf! It's, like, so unfair!

Jay : What? What ooh-ee?
Javier : There is something not right about that horse.
Manny : I think I saw it, too.
Jay : You didn't see anything. This horse is a heavy favorite. The rest of the
pack couldn't beat a merry-go-round. I'm sticking with Little Bacon.
Manny : It's your funeral. Who are we going with, dad?
Javier: Nobody in this race, papito. It was quiet down there in the paddock just
now... too quiet.
Jay : Oh, gee. You know what? Make it $300.
Manny : Oh, my.

Mitchell : I was so glad I talked to Alex, because she agreed with every single
thing I was feeling... which made me realize that I was acting like a 14-year-old
girl.
Walt : Ah, come on, kid. I just lost an arm 'cause of you. Now get your head in
the game.

Jay : I'm telling you, kid, this is the one. And you know how I know? 'Cause it
said, "pfft."

Luke : Sorry. I can't concentrate with my dad staring at me.

Javier : They don't talk like that.

Walt : I hope he's talking to you.

Phil : I just love you so much.
Luke : Ugh. Oh, great, now I'm dead. I'm going to the bathroom.

Gloria : "Maria bought a beautiful white dress for her wedding."

Walt : You know, they say that happens.

Haley : Um, Maria compró un hermoso vestido blanco para su... I-I'm sorry. I
cannot concentrate with him here. What are you doing?

Phil : Hey, Walt. You ever think about death?

Phil : Just taking it all in. You're a beautiful, intelligent woman... And don't
you ever forget it.

Phil : I got a call from the doctor. There's a 60% chance I'm gonna die.

Walt : I'm 85. Death is my roommate.

Haley : Wow, he is so weird sometimes.

Walt : Ha! Doctors... said I'd be dead ten years ago. Look at me. I'm healthy as
a... I gotta go change my tank.

Gloria : No, he's not weird! He's a saint! And you will miss him when he's
gone... One day.

Claire : Phil, you've gotta let this go.

Alex : Hey, Uncle Mitchell.

Claire : Honey, listen to me. You're gonna be fine.

Phil : I'm sorry, Claire. I don't know how to react when I find out there's a 70%
chance I'm gonna die.

Modern Family Season 3x11 page.5

Phil : You really think so?
Claire : I know so.
Phil : Claire's my rock. You know when you're on a plane and there's
turbulence, you look at the flight attendants, and if they're still smiling and
serving drinks, you know everything's gonna be okay? That's Claire. I could
also picture her as a cop.
Jay : Go Little Bacon. Go Little Bacon. You got this! You got this! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Commentator : And the winner is number 9 Little Bacon by 3 lengths.
Jay : Yes! I knew it! You see that, Manny? Dumb luck always runs out. But if
you live in the real world, and you use your head, not have it in the clouds like
Dr. Dolittle there, you'll do okay.
Manny : Guess we should have listened to Jay on this one, dad.
Jay : You got that right. You should have listened to Jay. And I'll tell you
something else. You can't look in a horse's eyes and tell there's something
wrong. You can't even look in their eyes at the same time... One's here and
one's here! Come on. Let's go to the window, kid. I may need some help
carrying my winnings.
Javier : Oh. Wait.
Manny : Jay, look.
Jay : Inquiry.

Mitchell : Cam was right. I-I was being petty. So I found his box of old
trophies and I decided to surprise him by having them on the mantle when he
got home. Well, I was the one who was surprised. I had no idea how many
trophies he had... First place, and all of them for different things. Music,
football, art show, science fair, a chili cook-off. A lifetime of accolades hidden
away just so I wouldn't feel bad.
Mitchell : Aah! That's a mouse! That's a mou... oh! Ew! Oh! Disgusting! Oh,
no! No, cam, I-I was gonna make a big display!
Cameron : I believe you have.
Mitchell : No, no, Cam! There was a... Oh! Gross!
Javier : Listen, Manny, do me a favor and get me a cappuccino from right over
there, okay?
Manny : No, it's okay. I got it.
Javier : So... You wanna talk about what happened back there?
Jay : Not at all.
Javier : You know... it is not just the horses whose souls I can read through
their eyes.
Jay : You really wanna know? I'll tell you.
Javier : Okay. I'll leave you alone.

Manny : What's that?

Jay : All right, listen, hang on. I'm sorry I went after you like that in front of
Manny. That was wrong.

Javier : It is when a horse has committed an infraction.

Javier : No, I get it. Nobody likes to lose at the races.

Jay : Possible infraction. Usually it's nothing. I'm sure...
Commentator : The number 9 horse Little Bacon has been disqualified for
interference.
Jay : What?!
Commentator : The winner is number 6, Bradswaxjacket.

Jay : I don't owe this guy anything. He stops by a couple of times a year to see
his kid. It used to be a relief, gave me a nice break. But now Manny and I, we
got our own thing. Look, I know I'm not his dad... Maybe I don't like the
reminder.

Javier : You see? The eyes... They do not lie.
Manny : Tough break, Jay. Here... Little something for gas.

Mitchell : Oh! Oh, my gosh!
Modern Family Season 3x11 page.6

Claire : Hey, what's up? What?
Mitchell : We came as soon as we heard.

Claire : No. He went to the doctor, he had some tests. The doctor called. That's
it.

Claire : Heard what?

Gloria : Plus today he run out of his lifetime supply of razors.

Mitchell : We heard Phil got bad news from the doctor.

Manny : That's a sign.

Claire : Who told you that?

Jay : This is a lot of hocus-pocus! I can't believe I bought a coffee cake over
this!

Mitchell : Gloria!
Gloria : No, I didn't say that he got bad news... I said that he was getting bad
news.
Claire : You don't know that he's getting bad news.
Gloria : I saw a black mouse.
Mitchell : I saw a black mouse.
Cameron : So he says.
Claire : Okay. You guys...
Gloria : Oh, this is worse than I thought!
Claire : No, it's not. Listen to me. Listen. Phil is fine. As a matter of fact, you
should go before he even knows you're here.
Gloria : No, no. We're staying.
Mitchell : We're staying.

Mitchell : Wait, wait, wait, no, no. I'm confused. What did the doctor say
exactly?
Claire : I don't know. We missed his call this morning.
Jay : The doctor called on Saturday?
Claire : Yeah. So?
Jay : Nothing.
Claire : Not nothing. Not nothing. What?
Jay : Well, it's just that, uh, Doctors don't usually call on Saturday with good
news.
Claire : But they could call... I mean, he could call with anything. Do you think
he's sick...
Phil : What's... what's going on?

Javier : We got here as soon as we could.

Claire : Nothing. Nothing. Everybody just came by for absolutely no reason at
all.

Gloria : Did you bring the coffee cake?

Phil : You look worried.

Javier : Yes, I have it right here.

Claire : I'm not worried.

Jay : He carried it in from the car. I paid for it.
Javier : Listen. Listen to me. I am very sorry for what you are going through.

Phil : Oh, god. The plane's in trouble. You put away the drink cart and you're
strapping in.

Claire : Thank you. Who is this?

Jay : You're gonna be fine, kid!

Cameron : Who, indeed?

Mitchell : You are gonna be great!

Javier : I am Javier Delgado, Manny's father and Gloria's former husband and
lover. I hope you do not think this is insensitive, but you are a beautiful
woman, and you will have no trouble to find a man...

Phil : Stop, please! You're freaking me out.

Gloria : Javier! The body is not even cold yet!
Claire : The body is upstairs watching basketball. He is fine.

Lily : Are you gonna die?
Phil : I don't know! There's stil a 5% chance I'll make it! It's Dr. Sendroff.
Claire : Okay. Okay.

Jay : Gloria said he was sick.
Modern Family Season 3x11 page.7

Phil : Guys, I don't know what's on the other end of this phone call... But
whatever happens, I just want you to know, you've already given me a lifetime
supply of happiness. I remember once as a child...
Claire : Do it!
Dr. Sendroff? What's the word? Are you serious?
Claire : What?
Phil : That's it?
Gloria : What is it?!
Phil : H-hold on one second. He's calling about a real estate listing. I'm fine.
Gloria : Ay, no.
Phil : Yesterday, you said you'd call if something was wrong. Then you called,
then you disappeared. That is the most irresponsible, unprofessional thing I've
ever heard of in my entire life! And do you have anyone to represent you in
the sale of your current house?
Javier : Look into his eyes. I don't care what the doctor says. I give him six
months.
Mitchell : Stop staring.
Chip : So, Phil Dunphy, tell us a little bit about yourself.
Phil : Well, Chip, I'm married to a great lady... Hi, Claire! And I have a baby
girl. Um, I'm a real estate agent, and I enjoy playing checkers.
Chip : Okay.
Phil : Both Chinese and American. And, uh, I am a fan of hip-hop.
Chip : Well, good for you.
Phil : Though I try to stay neutral in the whole east coast/west coast thang.
Chip : Next up we have a...
Phil : One quick thing... Shout out to my, uh, college buddy Ling, who built his
own helicopter and is taking his first flight today, and, uh, I also wanna wish a
happy anniversary to my in-laws Jay and Dede Pritchett. Your eternal love is
an inspiration to us all.
Chip : Okay. That's enough. Next up, we have a homemaker from West
Mifflin, Pennsylvania.
Woman : Hi.

3x12 : Egg Drop
Phil : So the five keys to investing wisely in a down real estate market are...
Keeep your cool... Keeep informed... Legwork.
Phil : I recently became a partner in a new agency, so I put together a seminar
to recruit first-time home buyers. I want to give 'em a step-by-step description
of exactly what I can do for them. Am I worried that they might write it all
down and just do it themselves? Quite frankly, I hadn't thought about it until
just now.
Haley : Do I really have to go to this thing?
Phil : Yes. You're a big part of today. You're my support staff.
Haley : Then why am I not getting paid?
Claire : That is a good question. And I think I'm gonna text you the answer on
that cell phone we pay for.
Phil : Honey, do you wanna practice your part again?
Claire : Uh, no. It's just one question. I think I got it.
Phil : Yeah, but it's the most important question because it launches me into
my big finish.
Claire : Yes.
Phil : That way, people leave excited.
Haley : Oh, I think people will be excited to leave.
Claire : Luke... Why?
Luke : I'm sorry. It's for school. I have to design a container that'll protect an
egg in a 1-story drop.
Claire : Yeah, so, um, you thought you would go with an egg carton?
Luke : What if the best idea was under my nose the whole time?
Claire : You're gonna need to come down and clean this up now.
Luke : Ugh! I wouldn't have to do any of this if Alex would just let me use
hers from when she took the class.

Alex : Never. That design is my intellectual property. I think it has applications
for unmanned space flight.
Haley : Keep talking like that and you'll go through life unmanned.
Alex : Funny.
Claire : Girls. Luke, honey, listen to me. You're gonna need to do this project
on your own. And you can do it. Just... really think.
Luke : I've got it! What if I'm the container?
Claire : There's a thought. You could be... No, Luke! Luke!
[OPENING CREDITS]
Gloria : Okay, si, te quiero. Mwah, mwah, mwah!
Manny : I understood "crazy old witch," "go kill yourself," then "I love you."
Jay : I'll never get this, how you all yell at each other.
Gloria : That's how you know that your family loves you... when they feel free
to scream at you.
Jay : Oh, I guess I owe my ex-wife an apology. Apparently, she was nuts about
me.
Manny : Darn it!
Jay : Try the next one over a frying pan. I could use some breakfast.
Manny : This is so frustrating.
Jay : At least you're getting your hands dirty for a change.
Manny : It is a nice break from the life of the mind I usually live.
Jay : That's the spirit.
Manny : Plus it's a metaphor for the human condition. Aren't we al just fragile
eggs hiding behind bubble wrap and bravado?
Jay : And we're back.
Gloria : Well, I'm sure that your egg-droppy thing is going to be the best in the
class.
Manny : Hmm. Except for Luke's.
Gloria : Really? Our Luke? But isn't he, like, a little, like...
Modern Family Season 3x12 page.1

Manny : I bet Claire's gonna help him, just like she did with his self-portrait
for art class. There was life in those eyes. It was haunting.

in case Luke has any questions. Do you think you can find somebody else to
help you with your seminar?

Jay : Tell you what. I'm gonna nip this in the bud. You deserve a fighting
chance. Hey, I'm calling about that, uh, egg project the boys are doing. Parents
aren't supposed to help out on that, right?

Phil : I don't know. That's a little last-minute. You're kind of irreplaceable.

Claire : Why would the parents be helping?

Phil : Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, Gloria? Quick favor.

Jay : Why do they cut grapes for 8-year-olds? I figure if you can eat a chicken
finger, you can tear your way through a grape.
Claire : Again, dad?
Jay : Oh, I'm sorry, it just... bugs me, is all. The point is, I'm not helping, and I
hope no one else is helping, either.
Claire : Okay, dad. Thanks for the heads-up. Love you. Bye-bye. Well, my dad
is doing Manny's project for him.

Claire : Well, I mean, it's just one question, and the seminar isn't for a few
hours...

Gloria : Okay. See you there. Bye-bye.
Jay : What was that?
Gloria : Phil. He needs help with a seminar that he's giving.
Jay : Why can't Claire help him?
Gloria : He didn't say.

Phil : He called to tell you that?

Jay : I'll tell you why... because she's knee-deep in Luke's egg drop project.

Claire : Oh, no. He called to tell me that he wasn't, which is exactly what you
say when you are, but you don't want anybody to suspect it.

Gloria : She said that she was not going to help.

Phil : Really?

Jay : That's exactly what I would say to me if I was helping my kid and didn't
want me to know.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Gloria : Why would you be talking to you?

Phil : What would you say if you had issues with your father?

Jay : I'm just saying it's unfair to Manny. The kid doesn't stand a chance on his
own. I'm tagging in here.

Phil : Claire and Jay are incredibly competitive.
Gloria : Tennis games, card games, everything. Who knows why?
Mitchell : Claire is the son that my dad never had. I mean, he just wanted
someone to throw a ball in the backyard. I did once, but... he did not attend.

Gloria : Jay, he doesn't need you to baby him.
Jay : I'm just gonna give him a few tips. Kid, get yourself a snack.
Gloria : Okay, I'll cut him some grapes.
Jay : Damn it!
Gloria : Not like that, Jay. Like this. Look.

Claire : Looks like fun.

Jay : It just irritates me, you know what I mean?

Luke : It was, but now it's hard.
Claire : Oh, I'm sure you're gonna do great, buddy... Eee...

Mitchell : We're meeting with prospective birth mothers.

Phil : Claire?

Cameron : We've had a few of these meetings, and they're very nerve-racking.
You want to look good, you want to make a good first impression... kind of
like a first date.

Claire : Uh, I am just showing interest in our son's project, which any parent
would... Think! Think... to do. Thinking... I am, that maybe I should stay here

Modern Family Season 3x12 page.2

Mitchell : Actually, it's... it's the opposite of a first date. You don't wanna have
sex, but you do want a baby.

Phil : As a matter of fact, there is. We'll work on that. It's the key to the new
home you've purchased below market thanks to Woosnum, Keneally, and
Dunphy.

Lindsay : I have to say, Lily is adorable, and such a good eater.

Gloria : Bravo!

Cameron : Oh, not all the time. She just happens to love my tuna salad.
Dolphin safe, of course.

Phil : Fire the confetti cannon, drop the banner, autographs, autographs,
autographs, and we're done.

Lindsay : Oh, who cares about that?

Haley : We still have, like, an hour left. Can I go shopping?

Mitchell : Well, I bet the dolphins do.

Phil : No. I-I have vocal exercises to do, and I need you to do a sound check
for me.

Lindsay : It's okay to eat tuna, but not dolphin? My theory is, a fish is a fish.
Cameron : Mm.
Mitchell : Well... A dolphin's actually a mammal, so...
Lindsay : Eh, to-may-to, to-mah-to.
Mitchell : More like tomato, cow.
Cameron : Mitchell, can you help me with the scones in the kitchen?
Mitchell : Okay.
Cameron : Excuse us. Okay, this is not really about the scones.

Gloria : Ay, I was hoping we could go to my hair salon. It's nearby. I didn't
have time to finish my hair this morning.
Phil : Really? That just happens?
Haley : Ooh, and I can get my nails done. Is it okay?
Phil : Okay. Sure. Oh, oh! Could one of you guys stick this under a chair on
your way out? One of the lucky attendees is going home with a brand-new
mouse pad. Wait, wait, wait, wait! I don't wanna see which chair. I wanna be
blown away like everyone else.

Mitchell : Oh, really? You didn't need help carrying six scones?
Cameron : No, this is about your need to correct everyone's every little
mistake.

Lindsay : Yes. Now that is feng shui. Doesn't that feel better?

Mitchell : I am sorry. I thought that she could use a basic biology lesson.

Mitchell : Yes, this is nice. It gives the room a nice flow, which I'm really liking.

Cameron : Well, let me give you a basic biology lesson... you and I can't make
a baby. So if she points to a lamp and calls it "Uncle George," what are you
gonna say?

Lindsay : Sometimes, your furniture tells you where it wants to be. Yeah. Do
you mind if I use your restroom?

Cameron : Oh, yes. This is wonderful for conversation.

Mitchell : "Pleased to meet you, Uncle George."

Mitchell : Not at all. It's... it's just down the hall. Just be warned... there's some
furniture in there that kind of likes where it is!

Cameron : Very good. Now let's get out there, smile, nod, and get ourselves a
baby.

Cameron : Okay, I know it's killing you to do this whole song and dance, but I
think it's going great.

Mitchell : Okay.

Mitchell : Cam, there's a limit, okay? We already promised her that we would
show her son all 52 states.

Phil : And those are your five keys. Now if there are no more questions... Ah,
yes, the lovely home buyer right here on the edge of her seat.

Lindsay : Oh, wow, you have a keyboard.

Gloria : I was wondering... I was wondering, is there a sixth key?

Lindsay : You're musical. I love that. It's very important to me.

Cameron : Oh, yes. That's mine.

Modern Family Season 3x12 page.3

Cameron : Oh, well, you're preaching to the choir. Literally. I've sung in
several.

Claire : Oh, well, you know, after so many landed safely, we thought we
should test 'em, make sure we weren't working with a super strong batch.

Mitchell : Yeah, we sing to Lily... All of the time. Mm.

Jay : Sounds like you knocked it out of the park.

Lindsay : I wish I could hear you guys.

Claire : Oh, yeah, definitely. We did. Um, so dad, if I find out what Phil did
with that soldering iron, I'll run it over.

Cameron : Oh, well, that's very sweet.
Lindsay : No, now. The baby's father is a musician, and I would love to know
that he's growing up in a musical household.

Jay : Great. 'Cause, uh, we're gonna test it later today at the school.

Cameron : Okay.

Claire : Fun. Maybe we'll meet you. We can come anytime, right? 'Cause we
don't have a... a spring problem.

Lindsay : Great.

Jay : Around five?

Mitchell : Okay. Now we are actually doing a song and dance.

Claire : Perfect.

Cameron : Okay, well, look at it this way... we're not only adopting a baby,
we're saving it from a life spent searching for east Dakota.

Mitchell : Okay. Bear with us. We're a little rusty.

Mitchell : Oh, God.

Cameron : Yes, and please put all cell phones on vibrate.

Cameron : This is actually nice.

[Singing]

Mitchell : This is actually very nice to lean on.

Cameron : Don't go breaking my heart
Mitchell : I couldn't if I tried

Luke : Ugh! It broke again.

Cameron : Honey, if I get restless

Claire : Mm. Yes, I saw. We'll just need to double up on the cotton.

Mitchell : Baby, you're not that kind?

Alex : Here, let me save you a step.

Cameron & Mitchell : Ooh, hoo Nobody knows it

Claire : Alex!

Mitchell : Nobody knows, When I was down...

Jay : Knock, knock!

Cameron : ...I was your clown. I really am a clown.

Claire : Dad! Hey! What are you doing here?

Cameron & Mitchell : Oh, oh, I gave you my heart.

Jay : Manny needs that soldering iron I lent to Phil. One of the screws on his
project keeps coming loose. Other than that, it's flawless. Huh. His latest test
run, he dropped it off the roof, he walked downstairs, it hadn't landed yet.

Cameron : So don't go breaking my heart

Jay : I had nothing. I had to get in Claire's head. Sometimes the best thing to
do in race to the top... is grease the pole behind you.
Claire : Wow. So Manny's still working? Luke finished a couple hours ago.
Jay : Is that why all these eggs are on the floor?

Mitchell : I won't go breaking your heart, Don't go breaking my...
Cameron & Mitchell : Don't go breaking my heart
[Stop singing]
Lindsay : Yeah, yeah. Thank you. It was wonderful. Oh. I'm confused, though.
I thought Cameron was the singer.
Cameron : Yeah. Oh... Yes, yes, I am.
Lindsay : Really? Because Mitchell has such a lovely voice.

Modern Family Season 3x12 page.4

Cameron : Well, I think he was following my lead. You know, a good leader
can make all the difference.
Lindsay : Actually, you were a little pitchy. But it was terrific, really.

Gloria : Taxi!
Phil : It's not rocket science, people, it's just a little red card. Okay. I guess
nobody needs a mouse pad.

Mitchell : Thank you.
Cameron : Yes. Thank you for your opinion.

Claire : How's my favorite kid doing?
Alex : Favorite?

Gloria : Faster! Faster! We're going to be late to your father. Why did you have
to do your toes, too?

Claire : Yeah, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But you know
what? We do. And the good news is, it's you.

Haley : Well, there's this really cute boy at school who's kinda into my feet.

Alex : I'm not giving you my design.

Gloria : Be careful. That can get really creepy fast. Ay. Where is the car? I
parked it here!

Claire : Who said anything about giving? We can work out an arrangement.

Haley : It's a tow zone.

Claire : What do you want? Money? I got a little something set aside.

Gloria : Somebody just put that there, because that wasn't here when I parked!

Alex : Okay. I shouldn't even be giving you this hint, but... first get a mirror.

Haley : It looks pretty old to me.

Claire : A mirror?

Gloria : Haley, don't lie. That was not here!

Alex : Then you're gonna look in it, and you're gonna see a crazy woman. She
needs your help.

Phil : Ladies and gentlemen... Get ready for one of the giants of residential real
estate... A salesman's salesman... Where are you guys? I've been calling you! A
realtor's realtor... You were supposed to do my intro. Now I have to. 2-time
nonconsecutive winner of the realtor of the year award... Just get back here by
the end. Future investors, stop making excuses! And start... making your
dreams come true! Ladies and gentlemen, Phil Dunphy! Hey! How are you?
Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it. Welcome.

Claire : You know, I made the egg that made you, that made that project, so in
a lot of ways, that design is already mine! Oh, you're fine.

Gloria : Taxi! You see? They don't stop because I'm Latina.
Haley : Or because that was just a yellow car. My dad is gonna freak out. You
have to take the blame for this.
Gloria : Why me?
Haley : Oh, because he'll never get mad at you. He totally puts you on a
pedestal.
Gloria : That's not true.
Haley : Yeah, it is. Let me just call the cab company.

Alex : It's cheating.

Phil : Are you sure that there are no more questions? No more questions? Yes!
If we could just get that over to the mustachioed gentleman.
Audience member : Yes, I was...
Phil : Oh, hey, I think we're all tired of that sound. Let me just come to you. I
bet I know what your question is. You're probably wondering if there's sixth
key.
Audience member : No, I was wondering about... I was wondering about
accelerated escrow.
Phil : If it works for both parties, it's a great way to expedite the deal. But back
to your first question about this mysterious sixth key.
Audience member : I didn't say anything...
Phil : The sixth key is the key to the new home that you purchased below
market using the simple principles that you learned here today... But not so
Modern Family Season 3x12 page.5

simple that you don't still need the professional services of Woosnum,
Keneally... and Dunphy! Thank you for coming. Son of a...

Phil : It was not her fault. Okay. What's done is done. Can you take the
brochures out to the car?
Haley : Wow. It's still full.

Mitchell : So, is there anything you want to know about us?

Phil : Yeah, it is.

Lindsay : I don't think so. In fact I don't think I need to interview any more
people. You guys are perfect.

Gloria : So it was not very good?

Mitchell : Are you saying what I think you're saying?

Gloria : Okay. But... but I'm so sorry, Phil.

Lindsay : Well, I'm not supposed to say anything to you directly, but I think
you guys should be expecting good news.

Phil : It's okay.

Phil : Um... no. I kind of need to sweep here.

Mitchell : Aah! Oh, gosh! Oh, I know, I know, you're not saying anything!

Gloria : No, it's not okay. We came late and we ruined your whole
presentation.

Cameron : But what you're not saying is wonderful!

Phil : These things happen.

Mitchell : Um, all right. I'm gonna get some sparkling cider? Yes, yes. Okay,
okay.

Gloria : Yeah, it happens and people get angry.

Cameron : It wouldn't be a celebration without cider or a celebratory song. But
this time, I want you to sit right here. So have a seat here. Let's just get this
mop out of the way there.

Gloria : No, it's not fine! I'm trying to have a real conversation, and all you do
is put me on a pedestal!

[Singing]
Cameron : If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooh,
ooh, ooh, no, baby, please don't go. Ooh, ooh, ooh, no, I just want you to stay.

Phil : Gloria, it's fine.

Phil : Wait a minute. You're mad at me?
Gloria : Yes, because that's not how family's supposed to treat each other!

[Stop singing]

Phil : You know how family's supposed to treat each other? They're supposed
to actually think about each other! I asked you to do one thing... and you were
too selfish and irresponsible to come through for me on a day that, believe it or
not, was really important to me! Oh, my God. You're crying. I'm so sorry.

Cameron : Yes, she was upset, but on a positive note, what I take from this
experience is, I can sing.

Gloria : No! That's what I want! You yell at me because you love me!

Mitchell : Uh, what we didn't take away from the experience is a baby,
because she decided to keep it.

Gloria : And you should be.

Gloria : Ay. No. Did we missed everything?
Phil : Yeah. They cleared out of here pretty fast.
Haley : Bummer.
Phil : More than a bummer, Haley. This was really important to me, and you
blew it.
Gloria : Ay, no, Phil, it was my fault.

Phil : Well, you made me mad.
Phil : Well, I'm not anymore.
Gloria : Don't treat me like that, Phil.
Phil : Because now I'm furious!
Gloria : Ay, mi familia! Si.
Phil : Oh, how do you do that? It makes me so... Mad.
Claire : That's a pretty nice piece of handiwork for a 13-year-old.
Modern Family Season 3x12 page.6

Jay : Yeah, Luke did pretty good, too, for a kid who still needs help getting out
of his backpack.

Manny : Oh, God. Oh, God.

Claire : Still your grandson.

Claire : So, uh, we realized a couple things up there, and I think apologies are
in order.

Jay : Felt bad when I said it.

Luke : Just stay frosty.

Claire : Okay, let's do this. Watch out, kids! They're coming down! One, two,
three. How'd we do?

Manny : OK, we admit it. We tricked you into doing our projects for us.

Alex : Both eggs are okay.

Luke : This is the first I'm hearing of this.

Manny : Great. So we both win.

Manny : We knew you'd do all the work if you thought you were competing
with each other. So I told you I thought Claire was helping Luke, and then you
called Claire...

Jay : Unacceptable. We're going up another level.
Claire : Absolutely. Come on. Third floor. Meet us there, Alex. Let's go.
Manny : Wait. You don't have to do this. The assignment was for a 1-story
drop. We both get A's.
Claire : We're doing this.

Claire : What?

Claire : Which got me involved, and...
Jay : All right. Here's what's gonna happen... you're gonna get in the car, we're
gonna drive home, and you're each gonna do your own projects.

Manny : I don't like this. The two of them talking up there... they're gonna
figure out what we did.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Luke : We did what we had to.

Claire : Hmm. Hmm. You know, this is your fault.

Manny : We're gonna get caught.

Jay : What?

Jay : Look at them down there. They're not even paying attention. This is the
best part.

Claire : The way we compete with each other it's... is sick. It's so sick, two 13year-olds know how to take advantage of us. And you know what? You made
me this way.

Claire : Actually, Manny looks kind of upset.

Jay : How do you figure that?

Jay : Why would he be? He's about to kick Luke's butt.

Claire : Dad! You pushed me into sports. You never let me win. You know, that
stuff... it does something to a girl.

Alex : Oh, knock it off. Luke and Manny had as much to do with this project as
they did with the Manhattan project.
Claire : You think that's what's going on? They're upset because we took over
for them?

Luke : Fine.

Jay : For your information, you came out of the womb like that. I'm not
entirely sure there wasn't a twin in there you bumped off.
Claire : If you saw that in me, why didn't you discourage it?

Jay : Maybe.

Jay : Why would I discourage something that I love?

Claire : They were supposed to... to learn from this, and... and we ruined it.
We should go talk to them.

Claire : Really?

Jay : Yeah.

Jay : You kidding? You're a fighter. The thing I love about you is you never
give up.
Claire : Dad.

Jay : Boys, we need to talk.

Jay : Even though I clearly designed a superior egg container.
Modern Family Season 3x12 page.7

Claire : Out of your mind, old man.
Jay : Only one way to find out.
Alex : Give up. You're all just playing for second.
Claire : There's something wrong with that one.
Alex : I'm not wrong. Mom can be crazy, right?
Haley : Hello?
Alex : Thank you. At the same time, I feel guilty when I get mad at her.
Haley : I don't think that's weird.
Alex : Just really proud of my project. I don't wanna share it.
Haley : Everybody has their own thing.
Alex : Thanks, Haley. I know I may sound dorky, but this late-night
conversations really mean a lot to me. They're the only time that I feel like I...
Haley : OK, Corey, just one picture. Hold on. Ugh, my feet look fat from this
angle. Hey, Alex, wake up. I need you to take a picture of my feet.

Modern Family Season 3x12 page.8

3x13 : Little Bo Bleep

Claire : I am angry, at that poll.
Luke : I think it's the yelling. I would tone down the yelling.

Gloria : Did you see it?

Claire : Honey, I don't yell for no reason.

Mitchell : Does she know?

Luke : You yelled at my teacher for calling me "special."

Phil : This is the last thing she needs today. No!

Claire : Honey, that was not a compliment.
Phil : Sweetheart, you're not unlikable.

Phil : Busy day at the Dunphy compound. We have a wedding tonight, and
this afternoon, Claire is debating Duane Bailey in the race for town council.
And now the "weekly saver" says that some voters find Claire... quote... "angry
and unlikable." To those voters, I say, "wait till she sees this."
Phil : No one can mention it to her. We can't have some unscientific poll
shaking Claire's confidence.

Claire : Thank you.
Phil : You just seem unlikable.
Claire : Ohh.
Phil : But if we work on it, it's totally fixable.
Claire : How? How, Phil? How are we gonna "work on it"?
Phil : First of all, lose the snippy attitude.
Claire : Mm-hmm.

Claire : Phil... What poll?

Phil : And I don't know... maybe we could have a mock debate.

Phil : Too late. She knows.

Alex : Oh. Good idea. That way, mom can rehearse her views on the issues.

Mitchell : Who told her?

Phil : Yeah, and we can point out all the little things she does that turn people
off. Like that look. I would lose that look. Spooky, but better.

Phil : What is this, a witch hunt?
Claire : Oh, my God.
Phil : I have to go.
Claire : Well, I just don't think it's a big deal. I mean, how many people read
the "weekly..."
Haley : "Saver"?
Claire ! "Saver," anyway?
Phil : 22,000... ish. My company adver... used to advertise with that
newspaper.
Claire : And how am I angry and unlikable?
Alex : Can I take this one?
Phil : I wouldn't.
Haley : You seem angry now.

[OPENING CREDITS]
Mitchell : All right. Thank you very much. Hey, Lily! Come here, honey! Hi!
Do you know what this is?
Lily : A box.
Mitchell : Containing?
Cameron : She doesn't know "containing."
Mitchell : Well, that's how she learns new words, by us using them.
Cameron : Or, that's how we lower her self-esteem, by bombarding her with
confusing vocabulary.
Lily : What's the box containing?
Mitchell : Told you.
Cameron : Okay. It's your dress. It's finally here!
Modern Family Season 3x13 page.1

Mitchell : Aah!

Jay : Any coupons for swim lessons? 'Cause Stella needs some.

Cameron : It's every little girl's dream to be a flower girl in a wedding.

Gloria : Seriously? Manny you teach to swim by throwing him in the pool, but
the dog gets swimming lessons?

Mitchell : It's Lily's chance to shine.

Manny : I gotta say, it was unpleasant but effective.

Cameron : I was a 3-time ring bearer.

Jay : We have to teach Stella how to swim. Otherwise, she could drown.

Mitchell : It's Lily's chance to shine.

Gloria : Why don't you teach her not to jump in the pool?

Mitchell : Oh!
Lily : Pretty!
Mitchell : Oh, no, Cam... Cam, she's gonna look like little bo peep.
Cameron : Or little bo cheap. Look at this fabric. It's already pilling.
Mitchell : Maybe it will look better on.

Jay : She didn't jump in the pool. She fell in the pool. Why, suddenly, would
she jump in the pool when she doesn't know how to swim?
Gloria : Why does she bark at the vacuum? It's a thing. It is never going to
play with you.
Jay : Are you saying that Stella is stupid?
Gloria : Are you covering her ears?

Cameron : You mean turned on?

Jay : Let's have a little compassion. She's probably still traumatized from her
near-death experience. Again? What's happening?!

Mitchell : No, it does not... Cam! Oh!

Gloria : Ay, no!

Lily : I love it!
Cameron & Mitchell : No, you don't.

Alex : Welcome, candidates. Mrs. Dunphy...

Cameron : Oh, my gosh. Are we really gonna let her wear this?

Claire : Thank you for having me.

Mitchell : You know what? If the bride wants to have a tacky wedding, she
can have a tacky wedding. Lily will be the bright spot.

Alex : And councilman Bailey.

Cameron : Literally.
Mitchell : Heard it as soon as I said it.

Phil : Gosh, thank you so much, Alex. I'm deeply honored to be here, and I
remain, as ever, a humble servant to the greatest little town in the greatest
darn...
Luke : Eye-rolling.

Jay : Stella! Where's my good girl? Gloria, is Stella up there?

Claire : Playful eye rolling.

Gloria : No. But I am. Why don't you say "hello" to your wife when you come
home?

Alex : How do we, as voters, know it's playful? I would avoid it.

Jay : Well, why don't you greet me at the door, wagging your tail? Stella,
honey! Where are you? Stella! My baby! Stella, I'm coming! I'm coming! You
okay? You okay?

Haley : And don't purse your lips like that. It makes you look annoyed.

Gloria : Why are you swimming in your clothes?
Jay : Because I'm self-conscious about my body. Stella fell in the pool.
Manny : It's my fault. I let her out, and then I got caught up in my couponing.

Claire : Okay. No eye rolling.
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Luke : And don't touch your face.
Haley : Yeah, no face touching. Seems nervous.
Claire : Some of this is subjective. What? What now?
Modern Family Season 3x13 page.2

Haley & Luke : Finger.

Alex : How would you respond to that, councilman Bailey?

Luke : It looks like you're scolding us.

Phil : I would like to use my lifeline.

Claire : I will keep my hands at my sides.
Phil : Not on your hips. You're not superman.

Claire : I'll take this. If elected, I would consider all perspectives, and I would
not ignore opposing viewpoints.

Alex : Can we get started?

Phil : Helicopter. Just keep going.

Claire : We haven't started?

Claire : I would consider all perspectives, and I wouldn't ignore opposing...

Alex : I've prepared some questions.

Luke : You suck!

Claire : Oh, goody! Actual questions.

Claire : Luke!

Phil : Honk. Sarcasm.

Luke : You have to be ready for hecklers.

Claire : Just go.

Phil : He's right.

Alex : Okay, Mrs. Dunphy, why are you running for local office?

Claire : Okay. I'm doing over. No buzzing. If elected, I... What?

Claire : Okay, that's, um, that's good. I... um, I...

Phil : Too close to the mic.

Alex : Mom, you really shouldn't stutter over a basic question like that. You
should at least know why you're running.

Claire : Phil, it's a hairbrush.

Claire : I thought the moderator was supposed to be objective.

Claire : If elected, I would consider all opinions and not ignore those of the
opposition, as councilman Bailey has done for six terms. What? That was a
great answer.

Alex : Not if she's the only one in the room who has actual debate experience.
Now why are you running?
Claire : I saw the need for a stop sign in...
Phil : Liar!
Claire : Phil!
Phil : I-I just think you should be ready for anything.
Claire : I saw the need for a s... What?
Luke : Sorry. Accidental buzz.
Claire : I saw the need for a stop sign in my neighborhood, and although I
collected the necessary signatures and did the paperwork, I found local
government to be entirely unhelpful... when... what?

Phil : Okay.

Haley : Well, I couldn't hear it because you were showing me the bad side of
your face.
Claire : I have a bad side? Yeah, the left.
Phil : No. It's the right.
Haley : Uh, dad, it's totally the left. I mean, look at it.
Phil : Sweetheart, why do you think I chose my side of the bed?
Claire : Okay! Okay. Thank you. Thank you, family. This has been super-duper
helpful.
Haley : Hands, lips, sarcasm, eye-rolling, wrong side of the face.

Haley : Too long. I'm bored.

Claire : Mm.

Luke : Yeah, next question. I feel like I'm in school.

Phil : Oh, yeah. Now I see it. Yep. She's ready.

Alex : Some say the political system is bogged down by ideological hard-liners
unwilling to compromise.

Cameron : And it's this, and it's this. Not this, but this.

Claire : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Mitchell : Okay. Okay, that's good, Cam.
Modern Family Season 3x13 page.3

Cameron : And this.
Mitchell : Save... let's save some petals for Lily, all right? Okay. Let's do it over
here, sweetheart.
Cameron : Right over here. Okay. There you go. Oh, like you're coming down
the aisle!

Alex : Mom, chill. It's just public access. My debate team's on public access,
and the only people who watch me are you guys.
Phil : Yep. All the time.
Claire : So maybe nobody will see this?

Mitchell : Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

Phil : No. We want people to see this. That's how you win elections. That's the
whole point.

Cameron : Not too many at once.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Mitchell : That's good. Okay. You're doing great, Lil.

Luke : Then mom should do something so crazy and stupid, it goes viral.

Cameron : Oh, she is, isn't she?

Haley : Mom, please don't go viral.

Mitchell : Forget the bride. All the eyes are gonna be on her.

Claire : Okay. I'll add that to my list of things not to do... don't touch my face,
don't roll my eyes, don't point my fingers, and definitely don't go viral. Do any
of you still believe in me?

Lily : Oh ***
Mitchell : I cannot believe you laughed!
Cameron : I am sorry. But you know I have two weaknesses... children cursing
and old people rapping.

Phil : Of course we do. We're on your side.
Luke : The right side. Not the left.
Phil : Let's grab a seat.

Mitchell : Cam, we have to tell her it's a bad word.

Claire : Right. Left.

Cameron : No. That just gives it more power. The less we make of it, the better.
Let's just pretend like it never happened.

Alex : Okay. Mom, just be confident.

Mitchell : Okay. Yeah, maybe it... maybe it didn't. Maybe we... maybe we
misheard.
Cameron : Yeah. Maybe she said "truck." Or... or "duck." Or "luck." She could
have said "yuck."

Claire : Mm-hmm? Based on what? I just lost a debate in my living room, and
people think I'm unlikable.
Alex : That's just the word men use for powerful women because they feel
threatened. So just forget everything else and be proud and powerful.
Claire : How did you get so smart?

Lily : Daddy, can I have some ice cream?

Alex : I've always assumed adoption or baby switch.

Mitchell : No, honey, if you're hungry, you can have some fruit.

Claire : Mm.

Lily : Fruit? ***

Alex : Hey. Hey. No kisses! Proud and powerful.

Mitchell : I have two children.

Claire : Sorry.
Alex : And no apologizing.

Claire : Phil? Phil, is this televised?

Claire : Yes! Shut up and get in there!

Phil : I didn't tell you because I didn't want to make you nervous.

Alex : That's more like it!

Claire : Great plan. Really good plan. Throw me for a curveball at the last
minute.

Claire : Uh-huh!
Alex : Yeah!
Modern Family Season 3x13 page.4

Claire : Oh, God.
Jay : There she is! Go get 'em, Claire.

Cameron : It's a Webcast? That would have been helpful to know 900 channels
ago.

Claire : Thanks.

Mitchell : No, it's on public access or something.

Gloria : Don't worry. We're going to cheer for you no matter what you say.

Lily : I wanna watch aunt Claire!

Claire : Oh, good. More support from my loving family.

Mitchell : Okay. Well, first, honey, we need to talk about something. It's about
that word you said this morning.

Phil : Sarcasm. Why'd you bring Stella?
Manny : She keeps getting out and jumping in the pool. We don't wanna take
any chances because she can't swim.

Lily : What word?
Mitchell : You know, the one that starts with "f"?

Alex : Then why does she keep jumping in the pool?

Lily : "Flower"?

Jay : I've been thinking about it. I got a theory. She might be suicidal.

Mitchell : No.

Gloria : What? That's crazy. There's not such thing as doggy suicide.

Lily : "Fruit"?

Duane : Hi. Duane Bailey. Sorry. I couldn't help but overhear. In addition to
being a public servant, I'm also an award-winning breeder of puggles. I've
won the puggly. Twice. And I'm afraid that doggy suicide is all too real. It's
just the mainstream media doesn't report on it, 'cause it's not as sexy as feline
A.I.D.S.

Mitchell : No.

Gloria : Stella is not suicidal. She's just... estupid.
Duane : Well, that might be part of your problem. She senses you don't like
her.
Jay : You have no idea. This one's been against this little angel from the very
beginning.
Duane : Yeah, well, dogs pick up on that. You know, they're very sensitive. I
like to call them, um... Bottomless pits of need. But not to their face, though.
That would just destroy them. Not you.
Gloria : So now this is my fault?
Jay : I think he knows what he's talking about. The man won a puggly.
Duane : Two. I won two pugglies.
Jay : We're done here.
Duane : In 2000... Yeah.
Cameron : Do you have any idea what station this is on?
Mitchell : Here, I'll look online.

Cameron : If she doesn't remember it, we shouldn't remind her.
Mitchell : Oh, well, she said it three times.
Lily : Oh, you mean ***
Mitchell : Cam, leave the room!
Cameron : No. I can do this. Lily, that is a bad word, and you are not allowed
to say it ever.
Lily : But it makes you laugh.
Mitchell : Okay, well, daddy shouldn't be laughing, and you should never say
that word. Do you understand?
Lily : Maybe.
Mitchell : Okay. This is not a game, all right? If you say that word one more
time, I'm gonna take away all your toys! I'm serious! She knows I'm not
serious.
Cameron : What about the wedding? What if she says it there? She's like a
ticking time bomb!
Mitchell : Well, what are we gonna do, cancel?
Cameron : Yes. Maybe we just call and say, "we're not going to any more
weddings until the gays can get married."
Mitchell : Oh, so now we're political? We leave town on gay pride weekend
because we don't like the traffic.
Modern Family Season 3x13 page.5

Duane : If you believe that, I have some talking puggles I'd like to sell you.
Duane : But there's no substitute for experience. For example, I doubt my
opponent is familiar with town ordinance 26-12B...

Haley : Do you believe this?

Claire : 26-12B has to do with noise pollution... something, sir, that you are
guilty of right now.

Duane : I won the puggly. Twice.

Phil : Oh, no she di'int!

Luke : Talking dogs? I'm skeptical.
Alex : Be strong.

Duane : Ladies and gentlemen...

Claire : I am glad that my opponent brought this up, as I feel that it speaks to
his character more than mine. I think that we should raise the level of
discourse and get back to the issues that the voters really care about.

Phil : Look at her eyes.

Man : When he was naked, what were you wearing?

Luke : I know. They're a little too close together. It's been bugging me for
years.

Claire : I... don't think that's relevant.

Phil : No, she's in the zone. She's ready for anything.

Claire : My personal life has nothing to do with this. Uh... the... my opponent
has brought this up to distract from his own record, which shows that in... in
six years, he has achieved nothing more than writing one ordinance that
allows private parties to have more than eight dogs. Hmm. Hmm.

Alex : Go, mom!

Duane : I do like to talk... about the issues. Speaking of issues, your husband
seems to have some.
Claire : I'm sorry? I'm not sorry. What?

Woman : Are you sex freaks?

Duane : Oh, well, I wouldn't want to bring it up, but since you asked, um... In
February of last year, your husband, one, uh, Phillip Dunphy, was questioned
at a local hotel for lewd and lascivious conduct.

Jay : It's like watching the "hindenburg."

Jay : Oh, jeez.

Jay : Stand by.

Claire : That's not true.

Phil : I am Phil Dunphy, and I am not a pervert. I, like a lot of men in this
town, enjoy making love to my wife. I mean, um... I mean with their wives.
Not me, them. Look, I should probably just sit down and say nothing. But it's
too late. I am standing, and I'm obviously talking, and now you're looking at
me, and I feel the need to keep going. First of all... No charges were filed.
Everyone had a good laugh... about the situation, not... not about me.
Everything's fine down there. Anywho... Where were we?

Duane : Ma'am, according to this police report, he, uh, broke into a stranger's
room, stripped naked... and then posed provocatively on the bed.
Claire : That is technically true, but in all fairness, it was Valentine's day.
Duane : Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. It was Valentine's day. I'm not sure, uh, if your
husband was born in this country. Ah. Perhaps he snuck in illegally, but here
in America, we celebrate Valentine's day with chocolates, not our private parts.
Cameron : This is my new favorite show.
Mitchell : Shh!
Claire : No, sir, he was looking for me, his wife, and he walked into the wrong
room.

Gloria : This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen in my life.
Phil : Excuse me!

Claire : All over YouTube. We went viral.
Phil : Some sick bastard auto-tuned me.
Phil : ♪ I... Like a lot of men in this town. I enjoy making love to my wife...
wife and I don't know how to stop. I am a pervert. Pervert... per... ♪

Gloria : Jay! Manny! We should have been there already!
Jay : Gloria, I'm tying my tie!
Manny : I'm accessorizing!
Gloria : And I thought I was the woman. The door. Ay! Estella, no! No! Ay!
No! No! Estella, don't do it! Don't kill yourself! You are a perfectly fine dog! I
don't hate you! Estella, okay, I was a little mean to you, but that's no reason to
kill yourself! You are young! You still have so much left to smell! Ay! I am... I
go! I'm coming! I'm... Manny! Ay! Come on, Estella!

Claire : Luke, honey. Lily, sweetie, are you excited to be a flower girl? Yeah?
Little bit nervous? Yeah? Why isn't she talking to me? Did she see the debate,
too?
Mitchell : Nope, she's on verbal lockdown.
Claire : Oh?
Cameron : She's been dropping a certain curse word all day.
Mitchell : Yeah, so we're just hoping the next one doesn't happen during the
wedding.

Jay : What happened?

Phil : If it does, it'll be the second most embarrassing thing to happen to our
family today.

Manny : Are you okay?

Claire : Phil, you said it wasn't that bad.

Gloria : She did it again.

Phil : That was in the car. We're in a church now.

Jay : And you jumped in to save her?

Claire : Honey...

Gloria : No, Jay! I wanted to take a little swim before going to the wedding!

Luke : Somebody turn her off. I think I'm having a seizure.

Jay : Get her a towel she's shaking like a leaf. Oh, no, no, I meant... I meant...

Phil : Oh, buddy.

Gloria : Thank you, Jay. The dog towel for me. For the wife.

Claire : Oh. Yeah.

Claire : Hi!

Gloria : Oh, good. I thought that we were going to miss Lily.

Mitchell : Hey, guys, hi. Hi.

Cameron : Ships at sea wouldn't miss Lily. Where have you guys been?

Cameron : Hey, what's shakin'? What's cooking?

Gloria : I had to jump in the pool to save the stupid dog...

Claire : You saw the debate, didn't you?

Jay : Who she loves.

Cameron : : The de-what?

Gloria : That I didn't let her down doesn't mean that I love her. I barely got
Manny back in the pool after that possum incident.

Mitchell : No, that wasn't... that was today? No, no. Was that on today? Oh, I
didn't remember.

Manny : I thought it drowned, but turns out it was just playing possum.

Claire : You are the worst liars.

Gloria : Yes, papi.

Mitchell : It was phenomenal television.

Phil : Good job!

Haley : Oh, Lily. What a... dress.

Claire : You know what the worst part of today was?

Cameron : Oh, well, you ain't seen nothing yet. How about there... we go.

Alex : I imagine it's hard to choose.

Haley : Wow. Ohh.

Claire : When everything was melting down, I realized I had an answer to
your question why I was running. I wanted to make my family proud, and I
did the exact opposite.

Alex : Yikes.
Luke : She looks like a lite brite.

Modern Family Season 3x13 page.7

Alex : No.
Claire : No, I did. I totally embarrassed you.
Alex : No. No, dad embarrassed me. I was proud of you. I think it's cool you're
running for local office. I mean, it's totally nerdy, and that's kind of my thing.
Claire : Hmm. Maybe it's kind of our thing.
Phil : Ah. Some day, I'll walk you down the aisle.
Haley : If you're not in perv’ jail.
Minister : Please be seated. Friends, family, thank you for making...
Mitchell : Really?
Cameron : Well, you know I cry at weddings.
Mitchell : Oh, no.
Cameron : What?
Mitchell : Stop... stop crying.
Cameron : Well, just because you have ice water in your veins, doesn't mean
that...
Mitchell : No. No, Lily... No. Lily... He's fine. Daddy's fine. Daddy's not sad.
Lily : Daddy, daddy! ***
Cameron : You see? I told you it was funny.
Lily : *** *** *** ***
Cameron : Excuse us. Congratulations.
Jay : Go on, you little motorboat! Look at her go! Where's she going? Oh, jeez, I
think she's trying to get herself sucked into the filter. What'd you say to her?
Gloria : I didn't say anything!
Manny : Wait a second. Jay, look.
Gloria : See? She was not trying to kill herself. She was just trying to get to the
squeaky wiener!
Jay : That must be why she's been jumping in. It must have been there all the
time. That's hilarious!
Gloria : Ay, si! No, it's not!
Jay : Not now. I'm saying it will be. Later.
Modern Family Season 3x13 page.8

3x14 : Me? Jealous?

Jay : I'll tell you if you can answer the following question... What's the
difference between a catfish and a lawyer?

Phil : Oh, I hope Tad likes salmon. It's a bit of a risk serving fish to a first-time
diner at Dunphy's. Maybe I should marinate a steak for backup.

Mitchell : I don't know. What?

Alex : I think someone has a man crush.

Mitchell : Zing! Honk!

Phil : First of all, I would never date a potential client.

Cameron : Okay, everyone, dinner is served! Let's get it!

Jay : Well, one's a bottom-feeding mud-dweller. The other's a fish.

Claire : That's "first of all"?
Phil : Secondly, I really need this to go well so he makes me his realtor. This
guy's flipping properties like they're extras in a kung fu movie.

Cameron : Our house is being fumigated, so Jay and Gloria invited us to stay
here for a few days. I am very excited to have 72 hours with this one.

Alex : So you're just kissing up to this guy for his money?

Gloria : We don't get to spend much time together, so I know that we're gonna
be like, um...

Phil : Not just. I really like him. He travels the world doing charity work, rock
climbs, flies planes...

Cameron : Fred and Ginger?

Luke : How does he have time to do all that?

Gloria : Who?

Phil : Got divorced, and his whole life opened up. Guy's living the dream. His
dream. Not my dream. I'm living my dream. You're my dream.

Cameron : Movie night!

Claire : You can stop.

Jay : It's nosier than usual around here.

Haley : I so don't want to do this.
Cameron : Oh, gosh!
Claire : Recently, Haley got a little creative on one of her college applications
and listed herself as a "big sister."
Haley : Technically, I am a big sister.
Phil : She capitalized the "b" and the "s."
Haley : Which makes sense, 'cause it was.

[OPENING CREDITS]
Claire : Tad, this wine is fantastic.

Phil : So Claire and I suggested...

Tad : Spend a week in Mendoza, and you'll find a dozen or so malbec
producers that'll give most Bordeaux a real run for their money.

Haley : Forced.

Claire : Mm.

Phil : That she volunteer for the organization. We couldn't be prouder.

Tad : I'm sorry. This should come with a warning... "may cause
pretentiousness."

Claire : We could. Little bit.

Phil : You should come with a warning... "may be fascinating." Oh! Excuse me.
Mitchell : Hey, dad? Did you accidentally leave this hilarious book of lawyer
jokes in the guest room?

Claire : Oh, oh, gosh! Oh. Ow. Oh, that's, like, the ninth time this screw has
popped out.

Modern Family Season 3x14 page.1

Phil : Oh, you know what? I need the angled screwdriver. I left it at the office.
Mm. I, um, I keep it there because o... of all my signs. I'll, uh, put up a "for
sale" sign, and next day, of course, I gotta put up the "sold" banner.
Claire : Yeah.

Phil : It's a progressive culture. Most of them travel by zip line.
Jay : Biscuits and gravy?

Phil : "For sale." "Sold." "For sale." "Sold."

Cameron : Yep, my grandma Bitsy's secret recipe, given to her by her
housekeeper Delilah, who raised her and was her best friend... kind of like
"The Help," except Delilah was white, and was actually herself quite the racist.
Eat up.

Claire : You're a great... great salesman.

Gloria : Good morning!

Tad : I'm getting that.

Manny : Hi, mom.

Phil : "For sale." "Sold."

Jay : Hi, sweetheart.

Tad : Right. Listen, I-I-I gotta go relieve the babysitter. My ex-wife took 50% of
my stuff and left me 100% of my kids. They're great.

Gloria : Ah, where did those come from?

Phil : Hey, listen, um, thank you so much for coming.

Cameron : Oh, I got a guy. You know, I just thought they'd brighten up the
house a little bit.

Phil : Then the next day, same deal... "for sale "sold."
Claire : Mm-hmm.

Claire : Yeah, yeah.

Manny : Yeah, I thought amaryllis were out of season.

Tad : Oh, no, thank you, Phil, so much for the salmon and the steak and the
chicken and the shrimp. I mean, it was all just delicious.

Gloria : Oh, that was so thoughtful of you.

Phil : Oh, great.

Gloria : I didn't realize that my house needed brightening up.

Tad : This guy is very lucky to have you. Okay. Thanks.
Phil : Yeah.

Cameron : There she is!

Tad : All right.

Lily : Gloria! Gloria!

Phil : Let me grab that.

Gloria : Ay! Let me fix your hair!

Tad : Yeah. Yeah. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.

Cameron : Oh. Well, isn't that sweet?

Claire : Bye-bye. Did you see that?
Phil : A handshake that almost became a hug? Yeah, I saw it. I lived it. I think
I'm in.

Cameron : I didn't realize her hair was broken.

Claire : No, honey. He kissed me on the lips.
Phil : Another good sign!

Mitchell : Ah! That smells delicious, but nothing for me. I've got an early work
lunch.

Claire : It's not a good sign. Sweetie, you don't think that's weird?

Jay : Really? I didn't hear an ambulance.

Phil : Well, the guy's a world traveler. He has a time share in Costa Rica. That's
probably how they do it there.

Mitchell : Yeah, it's funny because it's what I've dedicated my life to.

Claire : I don't know, honey. It felt like he lingered.

Mitchell : Booker Bell.

Cameron : Oh, is this that meeting with the deejay with the funny name?

Modern Family Season 3x14 page.2

Cameron : Booker Bell.
Jay : Booker Bell?
Mitchell : Everybody now!
Jay : Booker Bell was only the greatest deejay in the history of Drive Time
Radio.
Mitchell : Yeah, well, now he has some wetlands that developers want, and
we're trying to get him to donate for preservation.
Jay : When I was on the road selling, I used to listen to Booker all the time. He
practically invented the prank phone call.

Mitchell : The tax write-off alone makes financial sense. You know, even if you
take the environment out of it.
Booker : Well, don't take the environment out of it. Without the wetlands,
there's no ducks, and without the ducks, there's nothing for me to shoot at.
Mitchell : Okay. Well, we're shooting from two different angles, but, uh,
hopefully we'll end up at the same place.
Jay : Mitch.
Mitchell : Dad?

Mitchell : Okay. Wish me luck.

Jay : I just had to stop down and meet this guy. Booker Bell, I'm Boz Scaggs...
No! I mean Jay Pritchett. Damn it.

Cameron : Good luck, sweetie!

Booker : It's nice to meet you.

Jay : Booker would play a prank, the sucker would be twisting in the wind,
and just when you couldn't stand it anymore, he'd say, "guess who just got
their bell rung!" God, I'd love to meet him.

Jay : This is such an honor. You are hands down my favorite radio personality
of all time.

Cameron : Oh, they're just going down to Rae's. You should pop down. I'm
sure he'd love to meet a fan.

Mitchell : Okay. Well, thanks for stopping by, dad.

Jay : I don't know. I met Boz Scaggs once, got all tongue-tied.

Mitchell : I'll see you back at the house.

Cameron : Oh, you'll be fine. Oh! Oh, Lily, it's time for school, sweetie.

Jay : One time when I was driving from Youngstown to Sugar Creek, you
called this guy at a Kitty Litter Company and you asked him to bring over 900
pounds of litter, and in the background, you hear all these lions roaring, and...
I-I-I laughed so hard, I almost had an accident.

Gloria : Oh, I can take her.
Lily : Yay! Yay!
Cameron : Oh. That'd be great. Yeah, it'd give me some more time to clean the
kitchen. Maybe do a little dusting.
Jay : Delicious, Cam.
Haley : Annie was amazing, so funny and cute and sweet.
Alex : Yeah, you've said.
Haley : She made this for me last night. Look how she signs her name with
that big loopy "a." I'm totally going to frame this.
Alex : I made this for Haley four years ago. You think this got framed? She
tossed it in the garbage... Right after she wrote "Mrs. Haley Jonas Brothers" on
it, like, 30 times.

Booker : That's kind of you to say.
Jay : You know, I gotta tell you one thing.

Booker : The car or you?
Jay : Funny as ever! Anyway... Hey, are you still in touch with the old gang?
Grandma Groovy? Spaceman Clyde?
Booker : Are you kidding? I am the old gang.
Jay : No way.
Booker : I may be old, but I still know how to boggie.
Jay : My God, it's like she's here!
Mitchell : She is here! How are you still not getting this? That's her.
Booker : Excuse me for a sec.
Mitchell : What are you doing?
Jay : What? I'm a fan. I came down to say hi.
Modern Family Season 3x14 page.3

Mitchell : This is a business meeting. Do you have any idea how inappropiate
this is? No. No, of course you don't, because as far as you're concerned, all a
lawyer does is walk into a bar with a rabbi and polar bear.

Phil : Boy, do you know the way to this gal's heart.

Jay : Grizzly, 'cause otherwise, with the bartender...

Phil : Really? That's great.

Mitchell : Dad! I'm working! You're embarrasing both of us! Please, you gotta
go!

Tad : Yeah. Why don't you, uh, come over for dinner tonight? And, uh, we'll
work out all the details. One entree. Okay. Claire, you should come, too.

Jay : Okay, I didn't realize that.

Claire : Oh, no, no. No, no, if it's business...

Mitchell : Yeah. Yeah. You didn't.

Tad : I insist.

Jay : I'm sorry,

Phil : He insists. We'll be there. We're coming.

Mitchell : Go!

Tad : Okay. Yeah, shall we say, uh, 7:00?

Booker : Hey. Where's my stalker?

Phil : 7:00 sounds great.

Mitchell : Oh, he's gone. I've got rid of him. I'm sorry that he attacked you like
that.

Tad : Okay.

Booker : Attacked? No, I don't mind a little smoke of my bloomers.
Mitchell : Well, just I thought since this was a business meeting, we should...
Booker : And you thought that maybe hanging with somebody would make
me feel good with racket?
Mitchell : There's been a lot of tension between me and my dad. I'm actually
staying at his house...
Booker : Oh, so you chased away a man who's opening his home to you.
Mitchell : I get the sense that I'm losing you. Could I talk to Grandma Groovy?
Phil : : Honey, I'm home.
Tad : Hell, I didn't expect you so early dear..
Phil : What? You?

Tad : Okay. I didn't just come here to fix your table and get your wife drunk. I
actually decided to give you that listing on the sycamore property.

Phil : All right.
Tad : I'll let myself out.
Claire : Wow.
Phil : "Wow" is right.
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Phil : I just got sycamore... a house that sells itself and gives me the
commission.
Claire : How does that not bother you?
Phil : Claire, it's an expression. There's work. Inspections, appraisals...
Claire : He brought me wine, he took his shirt off when you weren't here!
Phil : Um, he brought us wine, and it doesn't look super vacuumed down
there. I'm surprised he kept his pants on.

Claire : Yeah, look who came by to fix the table.

Claire : Okay. Okay, I can see what's going on. You... you're just so focused on
getting his business, that you don't see what's going on in front of you.

Tad : Well, I had some time to kill, so I thought I'd drop by with that tool your
wife needed.

Phil : Okay. Now I do see what's going on.

Phil : Wow. What a guy. Yeah.
Claire : Mm-hmm. He also brought some wine.
Tad : Well, you said you liked it last night, so I had a couple extra bottles lying
around.

Claire : What?
Phil : Come here, pretty girl.
Claire : What? Mm?

Modern Family Season 3x14 page.4

Phil : You are, you know. You don't hear it enough. The other night, when you
put on makeup, I was like, "there she is."
Claire : Oh, my God. You think I'm making this up as some part of a-an ego
boost? Do you realize how insulting that is?
Alex : What are you doing?
Haley : Helping my little sister with her homework.

Manny : Cam, our shared bathroom is not the place to work out whatever's
going on here.
Manny : I'm a child of divorce. Conflict resolution is something of a specialty.
The key is, tell a personal story that applies to their situation, even if you have
to make one up. That way, they really hear what they need to hear.

Alex : That seems... mean.
Haley : Annie, this is Alex. That other sister I was telling you about.

Cameron : I'm sorry. You're right.

Annie : Hi. So nice to meet you.

Manny : No. I'm sorry I snapped. I'm just going through some stuff with this
girl I like, Danielle. She came over the other day, and Stella was all over her,
and--and I got jealous. Which is crazy, right? I mean, Stella was only playing
with her because she was new.

Alex : Um, if you're going to study there, you might need to correct numbers 7
through 10. This bed has higher standards than that bed.
Annie : I'm going to get some more lemonade. I think your sister's mad at our
sister.
Gloria : We're back!

Cameron : Manny, sounds like Danielle was trying to get between you and
your puppy, and that ain't cool. She seems immature, and you can do better.
I'm sorry to be blunt, but I'm going through something myself right now. So,
chin up. Okay.

Cameron : Oh, well, there you are. I guess "lunch then home" means different
things to different people.

Manny : It may not work every time, but you only need one fish to bite.

Gloria : We had a girls' day. Lily, Lily, come! Show your papa what we bought!
Lily : Matchy jackets!

Gloria : Who is this Danielle?

Gloria : It's like she's the baby leopard, and I'm the mama.

Manny : She's my study partner in my history class, and we share a notebook.
But her notes were really confusing, so I put them in order. Instead of thanking
me for making our lives easier, she got all mad because she thought I was
judging her.

Cameron : Or they just happened to have two jackets, one large, one small.
Gloria : What happened here? Where is my tea?
Cameron : Oh, it's in this drawer over here. As a thank-you, I took some time
to rearrange your kitchen so it makes sense.

Gloria : This girl is very bad news, Manny. You stay away from her.

Gloria : To who?
Cameron : To everyone. There's a flow now. Watch... Tea. Mug. Kettle. You're
welcome.

Phil : Hey.

Gloria : I didn't thank you.

Phil : We're Phil and Claire.

Cameron : You don't have to.

Tony : Hey, I'm Tony. Come on in. I'll go get my dad.

Gloria : I won't.

Claire : Okay.

Claire : Hi.

Modern Family Season 3x14 page.5

Phil : Great, thanks.

Tad’s daughter : Bye, daddy.

Claire : Wow. I don't like the way that kid was looking at you.

Tad : Bye, sweetie.

Phil : We are not friends right now.

Tony : Bye, dad.

Claire : I am only here to help pump up the college fund.

Tad : Have fun.

Phil : Claire, if Tad even makes a move towards you, his ass is... grass.

Kara : Okay. See you later. Come on, guys, let's go.

Claire : Really? I thought that was just my ego.

Phil : These stairs used to be teak, am I right?

Phil : So far, yeah, but just know, I'm ready to grass his ass.

Tad : This guy's good.

Tad : Hey, hey, hey, guys.

Claire : Yeah, he's good. He's sharp.

Phil : Hey! How are you!

Ellen : I forgot my bag.

Tad : Good.

Tad : You do that every time.

Phil : Good to see you.

Phil : Yep. I don't miss much.

Tad : Yeah.
Claire : Hi. That's good.

Haley : Oh, I'm sorry. Were you trying to read?

Phil : Well, I love the place.

Alex : You're the one who tries to read.

Phil : Did you remodel this?

Haley : Oh, my gosh! I am not that stupid!

Tad : Uh, actually, my ex-wife. She had a, uh, passion for modern architecture
and at least one modern architect. May have to sell this one next.

Alex : Seriously, Haley, you think you are the coolest person ever!

Phil : Really? Wow. I love how open it is. Do you mind if I, uh, poke around?

Alex : "Look at me! I'm so cool!"

Tad : Please, yeah.
Ellen : Tad, if you don't need my help anymore with the kids, I'll be going.

Luke : Enough! Enough! I am so sick of you two fighting all the time! You're a
bad big sister, and you're a bad little sister! And you're both bad big sisters to
me. Be normaler.

Tad : Thank you so much, Ellen.

Haley : Wow.

Ellen : You're welcome.

Alex : I've never seen him like that.

Tad : Okay. We'll see you later. Bye.

Haley : Well, we do kind of neglect him. And if you think about it, he is kind
of... our little sister.

Phil : Beautiful.

Phil : I saw this house eight years ago. There used to be a wall here, right?
Tad : That's right. That's right. That was all covered.
Phil : Yeah. I'm a detail guy. Hard to get much past me.
Kara : Hello, hello!
Tad : Hi, Aunt Kara! Hey! How are you?
Kara : Good, Tad, how you doing?

Haley : Would you please stop just judging me and everything that I do?

Alex : Remember how we used to dress him up?
Haley : I miss her.
Luke : I hear you, and I don't like where this is going!
Haley : You get the lipstick, I'll get the bra and tennis balls.
Alex : Betty Luke!
Luke : I will burn this house down!

Gloria : Where is the cheese grater? Where is the cutting board?
Cameron : Where would you want it to be?
Gloria : Yes, right here next to the cheese grater.
Gloria : I know it's hard to tell by looking at me, but I am not a natural
homemaker. So when Cam came and organized my kitchen, I felt insecure and
lashed out. In a way, I'm no better than Manny's crazy friend Danielle.

Jay : Listen, it goes without saying I've always been proud of you, and I brag
about you all the time. So if I say, "what do lawyers use as birth control?" And
the answer is, "their personalities," I want you to know I'm not referring to
you. You don't need any birth control. Hello? Yeah, this is Jay Pritchett. What?
When? What happened? It's the police. My car got stolen. Yeah, 2012. Gray.
No, not pewter. More like a light... Like a... no, not slate. I don't even know
what "coastal fog" is. Just put down "gray." Kilo? It's not my car. Yes, she's
Columbian. What does that have to do with... no, I'm coming down there.
Hang on. Grab your keys. I think I might need a lawyer.
Booker : Guess who just got his bell rung?

Cameron : Please, can we just focus on the cooking?

Mitchell : That's good. That's good.

Lily : Daddy, we forgot to give you this. It's like our jackets.
Cameron : I love it.

Tad : Here we go. Have a seat. I got a bottle of port from 1899.
Claire : Whoa.

Cameron : I guess I've always been a little sensitive about Lily not having a
mother, and Gloria's so good at it. I got jealous. Maybe I should tell Manny
this story. It might help him with that train wreck Danielle.
Cameron : You know what? Why don't you turn that music back on. Was kind
of nice.

Phil : Wow!
Tad : Okay, I got it for $18.99... But it's a good one.
Phil : Fun night, right? Great dinner?
Claire : Yes. Yes, and... Tad is... great, and I know I was giving you a hard
time...
Phil : Hey.
Claire : But I feel like I should say that I am sorry.

Mitchell : Hey, dad...
Jay : No need to talk about it. I was out of line coming down there, won't
happen again. Scotch is at the bar.
Mitchell : No, I've been giving this a lot of thought.
Jay : I guess we're gonna talk about it.
Mitchell : I was rude to you. I think I was just annoyed by all the lawyer jokes.
I mean, let's be honest, you don't exactly beam with pride over what I do for a
living.

Phil : Hey, hey, hey, Claire, you don't need to explain. Your apology is apology
enough.
Tad : Oh, I forgot the best part of the Costa Rica story. So we get home, and
they've taken over the living room, they've taken over the kitchen, I mean,
they're in the food, they're on the bed. And finally, after two years of
complaining to Diego about this, he finally stops and says, "okay, now I see it.
You do have a monkey problem."
Claire : A monkey problem!

Jay : Mockery is the sincerest form of flattery.

Phil : Yeah, I heard him the first time.

Mitchell : Pretty sure that's... that's not the saying, but, um, you know, Manny
told me a story about his friend Danielle. She sounds like a real piece of work,
by the way. But, uh, it made me realize that I take myself a little too seriously.

Phil : You can kiss my wife, you can take her to bed, but you cannot make her
laugh. I wanna go back. You can kiss my wife, but only I can take her to bed
Modern Family Season 3x14 page.7

and make her laugh. I wanna go back. Only I can take my wife to bed, comma,
and make her laugh.
Tad : I mean, they're in everything. The only thing they didn't touch... the
bananas.
Claire : The monkeys love bananas! You would think they would love the
bananas.

Phil : Sometimes, I really don't understand you.
Claire : I know. It's stupid, but it's nice to know that sometimes you'll fight for
me, and all I have to do is laugh at some other guy's story. But no one makes
me laugh like you do.
Phil : As long as it's always genuine.
Claire : Mm-hmm.

Phil : Yeah, we should go.

Phil : You can fake anything you want with me, but not your laugh. I'd like to
go back.

Claire : Come on. The bananas...

Claire : Yeah.

Phil : Yeah, we need to go. We gotta get going.
Claire : Oh, no, no, no.

Luke : Stop it! Leave me alone!

Phil : Yeah, yeah, we're late.

Alex : Hold still!

Claire : But he just opened the...

Haley : Stop moving!

Phil : We're late for getting home. Thanks for everything. Just...

Luke : I hate you! Get off of me!

Tad : Oh.

Phil : What... is going on?

Claire : Okay.

Claire : You guys are in a lot of trouble. Haley, I told you to clean this mess up,
and, Alex, your books are everywhere. Betty Luke, sit down while your dad
gets the camera.

Tad : Okay.
Claire : What is wrong with you?
Phil : You laughed like it was "who's on first?"
Claire : What? He's on second.
Phil : Don't try to cheer me up.

Phil : Got it.
Claire : Last time, you made a funny face and we didn't really get a good shot,
so let's work on our smile.
Phil : Okay. Good to see you, Betty Luke.

Claire : I know what's going on here. You're jealous.
Phil : Of him? He's not even funny! What's he got? Like, a soft ten minutes?
And he goes to the Costa Rican well a little too much for my taste.
Claire : Oh, God.
Phil : Really? This is still about the monkey?
Claire : No! No, no, no! It's you. You are making me so happy right now. You
stormed out of there, and you're acting like an idiot.
Phil : You like this? Because I am really uncomfortable.
Claire : Honey, I love it. Makes me feel special.
Modern Family Season 3x14 page.8

3x15 : Aunt Mommy
Phil : Whoa. What's all this?

Cameron : I might.

Haley : Mom heard us say we were bored.

Phil : I have to go show a house. But first, what was Elton John's sexual
orientation in the '70s?

Phil : Suckers.

Haley : Bye.

Alex : She heard us from outside.

Alex : You've done that one before.

Haley : She has super good hearing, like a seeing eye dog. They have
overdeveloped hearing to make up for the fact that-- Wait, the dogs aren't
blind. Wait. Are they? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Phil : And it never gets old, like the good Captain Fantastic himself. Hey,
Claire, guess what?

Alex : You're right. If I wait long enough, she can get there by herself.
Phil : Quick, girls... famous Danny from "Moonstruck." Aiello?
Mitchell : Hey, Phil. I'm glad I caught ya.
Phil : What's up?
Mitchell : Uh, it's about Steven and Stefan. They wanna see that house on
Briar again.
Phil : Really? I showed it to them five times. Last time we were there, I think
they got mail.

Claire : I'm sorry, honey, I can't talk right now. I told Bethenny I would take
her to the airport. I'm late, and she's gonna miss her flight. Where are my
keys? Why is that chair still here? I thought you and Luke were gonna put it
out on the sidewalk.
Phil : So you can't talk unless it's about my chores?
Claire : Why don't you just do it now, and you won't be so bored?
Phil : You heard that?
Claire : I hear everything.
Luke : That's for me.

Mitchell : Yeah, well, that's why I'm calling. They hate upsetting people,
unless, of course, it's me. Then they don't mind waking me up at 7:00 A.M.,
asking me to call you.

Phil : Hey, Leon. Nice buzz cut.

Phil : It's no problem. I'm just hanging around. Kind of bored, really. What?

Phil : Nice to see you.

Mitchell : Well, we did our good deed for the day.

Claire : Oh, no. No... oh, God. Um, Alex, do not move. Haley, clean this up,
okay?

Cameron : Yeah, for the enemy. Don't they have enough?

Leon : Yeah, for some people, the shampoo doesn't work. It only makes the lice
angry.

Haley : Who fills a vase with marbles?
Mitchell : It's been about a year since we decided to adopt a boy. Meanwhile,
our friends Steven and Stefan decided that they wanted a baby, too.

Claire : Who doesn't see a vase filled with marbles?

Cameron : Wonder where they got that idea?

Phil! Honey, the girls need you in the kitchen!

Mitchell : Well, we're still waiting, but they already got their kid because they
went through a surrogate.

Luke : Thanks for the hat, Leon. It kind of tickles.

Cameron : Which is all they talk about.

Leon : How much electricity do we need to bring this back?

Alex : Who wants to hear a bunch of plates crashing?

Claire : Phil!

Mitchell : Are you gonna keep doing that?
Modern Family Season 3x15 page.1

Luke : It's not rocket science. We're only reanimating a squirrel.
Claire : Phil! Now!

theater tickets... don't knock yourself out trying to... Oh, you did? Well, sorry
to do this last minute, but they can't go. No, Manny has a football game, so...
Manny : Jay, could you steep my tea?

[OPENING CREDITS]

Jay : I cannot express to you enough how much this kid needs football.

Jay : Sounds great. No, hang on. Gloria, where's Manny? Some neighborhood
kids have invited him to play football.

Phil : And that is the whole house... Again.

Gloria : He said he was taking his morning constitutional.

Stefan : I love it. I absolutely love it. I'm just not sure if I'm in love with it.

Jay : He's working on his go-cart, but he'll be there. Okay. See you then.

Phil : Oh, yeah.

Gloria : No, Manny cannot go and play with those boys. Margo is trying to get
us theater tickets for this afternoon.
Jay : Gloria, you and Manny do enough together. Let's let him decide. Where's
he walking?

Steven : I love it, but I just don't love it. Do you love it?

Phil : We have an expression around the office for when a sale just isn't
happening... "Commission: Impossible." Maybe for some people.

Gloria : I don't know. But according to the song he was singing, he was going
to the sunny side of the street.

Phil : Not sure if I mentioned it before, but the house does come with a
hookup for a European washing machine.

Jay : I cannot express to you enough how bad this kid needs football.

Stefan : Oh, I love that.

Manny : Mom! Look what I found! Number 99!

Phil : Oh, so sorry. It's the boss. Hey.

Gloria : When Manny was 5, we didn't have much. We were on our own. So
we always dreamed of winning the lottery.

Claire : Hi. I'm on my way home. I've been calling Haley, but nobody's
answering. Is everything okay there?

Manny : We figured if we collected 100 lucky heads-up pennies and bought a
ticket with them, we couldn't lose.

Phil : Everything here is great.

Gloria : But now I have a wonderful husband, a beautiful home... I feel like I
already won the lottery.

Phil : Not yet.

Manny : So I can keep whatever we win?
Gloria : I think no. I found most of them.
Manny : Can you put this in the jar with the others?
Gloria : Sí. Ay. I forgot. What is the combination to your safe?
Manny : I'll just come with you.
Jay : Oh, yes, 'cause that's how this arrangement works... I take money from
you! Hello? Oh, hi, Margo. No, she just ran upstairs. Listen, about these

Claire : Oh, thank God. Did you put the chair out front?
Claire : Honey, you're gonna miss the trash pickup.
Phil : Don't worry. If they don't take it, someone else will.
Claire : Who is gonna pick up that ratty chair off our lawn?
Phil : Are you kidding? It's in great shape. Super cozy. People are always
commenting on it. Trust me, it'll be gone by the end of the day.
Claire : Please, just do it now.
Phil : I can't. I'm so sorry. When I'm done with these clients, I'll call Luke and
Leon. I know I can talk them into it.
Modern Family Season 3x15 page.2

Steven : We are not losing this house to Luke and Leon.

Mitchell : Yeah, maybe we should think about this swirl.

Claire : What do you mean, "call Luke and Leon"? Aren't you at home?
Phil : No, I left right before you did.

Cameron : Well, I-I didn't think surrogacy was for us. But, you know, 'cause
one of us would feel left out.

Claire : Phil, the house... the... the kids... Oh, God, the squirrel.

Mitchell : Yeah, but if you don't know whose it is...

Phil : Hello?

Stefan : Sorry we're late. Guys, meet Roco.

Steven & Stefan : We'll take it.

Cameron : Roco or cocoa?

Phil : Oh!
Jay : Look at him out there.
Phil : Commission... Accomplished.

Gloria : Oh, ay. This is so exciting.
Jay : Go ahead! Attaboy! Go! Go ahead! Attaboy!

Mitchell : So how great is your life right now, huh? A new house, a new baby,
Stefan's Propecia's kicking in.

Gloria : Go, Manny! Run!

Steven : Ooh. That's him. He's on his way. He texted "OMW." We try to keep
our texts short when we're driving with the baby.

Jay : I knew Gloria would find out I lied about those tickets. But I figured
when she saw Manny out there, playing with all those other kids, she'd thank
me. That's what I figured.

Cameron : Oh, well, what wonderful parents you are.
Steven : You guys hate us a little bit, don't you?
Mitchell : No. God, no.

Jay : Go! Go! What the hell's he doing?

Cameron : Just a little.

Gloria : Run, Manny! Run!

Steven : Have you thought about surrogacy? At least you'd be making a baby
instead of waiting around for some pregnant mom to maybe pick you.

Manny : Mom! Number 100! Now we have the lucky... Oh!

Cameron : Well, we considered it, but how do you decide which one will...
Where's Lily?

Claire : Oh, thank God. Nobody's dead.

Mitchell : Sleeping.

Claire : How many plates did we lose?

Cameron : Ice the cupcake.
Mitchell : That you couldn't say in front of Lily?

Alex : None. Luke and Haley used cookie sheets to clear a path through the
marbles for me.

Cameron : Well, then, she'd want a cupcake.

Claire : Where are the marbles?

Mitchell : Yeah, well...

Haley : Right here.

Steven : But that's the beauty of the swirl.

Claire : Oh, Haley!

Mitchell : The swirl?

Haley : I put glue on them so it doesn't happen again.

Steven : You both donate, they mix it up, fertilize the egg. You never know
who the father is. Ooh. That's Stefan.

Claire : What about the chair?

Luke : Or... we're all dead.

Luke : Leon and I rolled it outside on some skateboards.
Modern Family Season 3x15 page.3

Claire : Oh. The squirrel?

Mitchell : Phil, you really didn't have to do this.

Alex : You think I was going to let that happen?

Phil : I sold a house today because of you two. The least I can do is buy you
dinner.

Claire : These kids are going to survive. They are the best of me and Phil. Luke
using the skateboards, Haley gluing the marbles... that is pure Phil. Alex
keeping everyone in line... pure me. Sometimes I worry no one's gonna like
Alex.

Claire : I saw that house. It is gorgeous.

Jay : There you go, buddy.
Manny : Thank you. Uh...

Phil : I know.
Mitchell : Yes, we're real happy for them.
Jay : They showed me a picture of the baby. How adorable is that little guy?
Cameron : Yes, we're real happy for them.
Mitchell : Okay, you might wanna slow down there.

Jay : What? You need anything? I'll get it.

Cameron : What? I'm playing a new drinking game. It's called "every time I'm
depressed, I take a drink."

Jay : Steak sauce, but it's okay. It's probably good for me to move around.

Mitchell : That game exists. It's called alcoholism.

Gloria : Oh, Jay, it's so nice to see you take care of him like that.

Cameron : Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm... I'm wallowing, and it's not cute. To
happier things.

Jay : Why are you surprised? He's our kid. We take care of each other in this
family.

Mitchell : Yes.

Gloria : I want to kill you.

Phil : To happier things.

Jay : Wild guess... Margo? Let me explain.

Claire : Happier things, yes.

Gloria : There is no excuse.

Phil : There you go.

Manny : This is something private. I'm gonna get outta here.
Gloria : So that's why you were being so nice. You lied to my friend... You
made Manny play the American football... It is your fault that he got
estampeded.
Jay : Or is it your fault? He stopped to pick up a penny, for God's sake.
Gloria : Be careful what you say, Jay. You're skating on thin eggshells right
now.
Jay : I tried to get him out there with kids his own age... Which is what he
should be doing... And not spending another afternoon with his mommy.
Gloria : If you have a problem with the way Manny's being raised, you talk to
me!
Jay : I am.
Gloria : I don't wanna hear it!

Phil : I remember the first few drinks... And, um, after that, the night's just bits
and pieces.
Claire : I wanna do something I never do... brag about my kids. Today, they
were resourceful, they were responsible, they...
Phil : Put 40% down. It was worth showing the house five times and waiting...
Cameron : Almost a year. Seriously! Who do you have to...
Phil : Blow. That's really hot. Why don't you let it cool down? Try some of
the...
Mitchell : Mexican! The baby is clearly Mexican!
Cameron : So, you know, the swirl is out.
Mitchell : Ugh. It's enough to make you lose...
Modern Family Season 3x15 page.4

Claire : Track. Is this my fourth drink? It's my fourth. I said "four" twice, didn't
I? I did, didn't I?

Cameron : We want that.

Mitchell : I think we're gonna need four cabs...

Mitchell : Yes.

Phil : Two! Two!

Claire : I have, like, magic eggs or something.

Mitchell : You made me!

Mitchell : Yes!

Claire : And something else... Guys, I make really good babies.

Claire : They're golden.
Phil : I-I vaguely remember... someone crying?

Mitchell : Oh, gosh. Oh, Phil, I don't... what do... what do you say about this?
Phil : I think we're all having a baby! Aah! Table hug!

Cameron : : If we ever did surrogacy, I would want you to be the donor.
Mitchell : Mnh-mnh!

Phil : Sweet potato fries!

Cameron : You're so smart, you're so handsome.

Claire : What have I done?

Mitchell : Oh, stop it! It should be you! You're so fun! You're so talented!

Phil : I know.

Phil : Okay. It's not fair. I love you both so much. If you could have a baby that
was a mix of the two of you, I would love that baby so much.

Claire : Oh.

Claire : Aw, that is so sweet.
Phil : I meant it.

Claire : What was I thinking? I-I-I just get drunk and I bring a baby into the
world?

Claire : That is so sweet. Oh, my God. You guys, we could do this. We could
do this. We could make a baby that is half Tucker and half Pritchett.

Phil : That would be 4 for 4.

Phil : Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Claire : Yeah.
Phil : Cloning?
Claire : No. No. I'm saying... I give the egg.
Phil : Oh!
Claire : Yeah. I give the egg. That's the Pritchett side. And then, Cam, you're
the father, right? And then we just, like, mix it and put it in a, like, a surrogate
lady thing, and then bang! We have a baby.

Claire : I can't go through with it.
Phil : Don't panic. You haven't donated anything yet. Besides, what are the
chances your eggs even work? What are the chances we can pretend I never
said that?
Claire : It's weird. It's my brother. And then there would be this baby over
there that's my baby, but it's not my baby...
Phil : That actually sounds good. Just say that. We're gonna see him for brunch
in two hours over at your dad's.

Mitchell : Oh. Are... are you serious?

Claire : Ooh. That seems... soon and... and hard. What if... what if I blame it on
you? What if we say that you're not okay with it?

Cameron : You would do that?

Phil : No!

Claire : I would be honored. You guys, you guys, if there's one thing I have
learned today, it's the pleasure of looking at your children, and seeing both...
both of you in there. And I want you to have that experience. Yeah.

Claire : Why? Are you really okay with another man fertilizing your wife's
egg?
Phil : Of course not! That's creepy.
Modern Family Season 3x15 page.5

Claire : Yes.

Phil : Best time ever in this house!

Phil : Plus, what if you and Cam make a better baby than we did?

Manny : I'm uncomfortable with this, Phil. The manual specifically says "no
towing."

Claire : It's settled. Phil says "no."
Phil : Like they're really gonna believe that I overruled you?
Claire : Right.
Phil : Come on.
Claire : Mm. They're gonna be crushed. They've waited so long for this baby.
Phil : Maybe they're having second thoughts, too.
Cameron : Look... this is what my baby with Claire would look like.
Mitchell : What is this? What...
Cameron : Okay, well, I found a web site where couples can upload pictures...
And then it shows them what their baby would look like. This is... Gloria and
I. Couldn't resist.

Phil : There are two types of people in this world... people who follow the
manual, and people who stick it to the manual. You... are hurt.
Mitchell : Hi!
Cameron : Manny, what happened?
Manny : Football injury. My mom will yell you all about it.
Gloria : Hola, Lily! Does my little princess want a cookie?
Cameron : Oh, well, you know, maybe just one. She's already had her sugar
limit for today.
Gloria : How can you tell?
Lily : Aah!
Gloria : Ay! Okay, Lily.

Mitchell : Wow. That... that looks exactly like Manny. Like... like weirdly so.
What... what's this other picture?

Claire : Hey.

Cameron : Don't be jealous. But this... Is me and Justin Timberlake.

Cameron : So where... oh, where are the kids?

Mitchell : Cam, we have a problem.

Claire : Oh, Haley's driving them over separately.

Cameron : Oh, what? You can talk about Ryan Gosling all day, but the moment
I say something--

Mitchell : Oh. Oh! Big girl now.

Mitchell : No, no, no, about this baby. I... I don't think I can do it.

Phil : So that was... so fun last night.

Cameron : What--why? Why--it's perfect! It's our chance to have a baby that's
part me, part you!

Mitchell : So fun.

Mitchell : No, no! It's part you and part Claire. I'm nowhere in there. And it's
not like I can pretend. It's... she's not some egg donor that we don't know. It's
Claire. You know, we see her all the time. And what are we supposed to tell
the baby? "Say hi to your aunt mommy!"

Mitchell : Hey, you two.

Claire : That's great.

Cameron : Yeah, we had a great night.
Claire : Yeah. Yes.
Phil : We should... Jinx!
Mitchell : Yeah, we're going this way, so...

Cameron : Adorable.

Cameron : This should do for 30.

Mitchell : No, not adorable. Appalachian. Okay, I'm... I'm sorry, Cam.

Phil : Yeah.
Mitchell : We'll see you in a bit.

Gloria : Jay says that I'm smothering Manny... But I'm just enjoying him. I
mean, they're only gonna be boys for a short time.

Claire : I cannot tell them. I cannot break their hearts.
Modern Family Season 3x15 page.6

Phil : So you're gonna have Cam's baby just to keep things from being weird?

Gloria : Ugh! You're not gonna do that.

Alex : : Um, what? You and Uncle Cam are having a baby?

Mitchell : It's not your decision, dad.

Phil : Kids, shh. There was a discussion about the possibility...

Jay : You're not thinking straight.

CLaire : Mm-hmm.
Phil : Of your mom donating an egg... so that the guys could have a baby.

Mitchell : And you're not in charge. Okay, Claire and I are adults. If... if we
want this to happen, it... it's gonna happen.

Claire : But we decided it was not a good idea.

Claire : So much for second thoughts.

Luke : Why? Because Lily's such a mess?

Jay : Young lady, I need to have a talk with you.

Phil : For a lot of reasons. They have...

Claire : I don't... now?

Luke : But we can agree that she's a disastrous human being?

Gloria : No. You don't get to tell everyone how to live their lives, that boys
cannot spend time with their mommies or that brothers and sisters can't make
babies.

Haley : I think it's a great idea.
Alex : Yeah. It's a really beautiful offer, mom. I'm impressed.
Mitchell : Oh, my God. Cam, they told the kids already, and they seem to be
totally into it. All right, is it just me? Am I the only one that thinks this is
weird?

Jay : So you're all for this?
Gloria : No. It's a freak show, but it's their freak show.

Cameron : Maybe it's not weird. Maybe we're pioneers.

Cameron : So this is happening again?

Mitchell : Mm, no we're hardly pioneers. You have three different hair dryers
for different types of weather.

Mitchell : Well, I'm not gonna not do it 'cause my dad thinks I shouldn't.

Cameron : Maybe it's just gonna take some time to get used to the idea.
Jay : What idea?

Mitchell : We're not doing it 'cause I don't want to do it. What we're not doing
is not doing it 'cause he doesn't want us to do it.

Mitchell : Oh. No.

Cameron : Just say baby or no baby.

Cameron : Um, well, Jay...

Jay : Isn't it enough this family spends a lot of time together? Now we have to
inbreed.

Mitchell : Cam.
Cameron : Claire has...
Mitchell : No. I-I-I just don't think my dad's really ready for this conversation.
So...

Cameron : You know, I'm not following.

Claire : Okay, dad, it's not technically inbreeding. It's, um...
Alex : For the record, I think what my mom is doing is very brave.
Haley : I like it. I've always kind of wanted a half-brother, half-cousin.

Jay : Oh, stop acting like I'm some stodgy old coot. I've grown.

Jay : Really? "Always"?

Cameron : Okay. Um, Jay, Claire has, um, offered to give us one of her eggs so
we can have a baby that's half Pritchett, half Tucker.

Haley : Well, I mean, if you think about it...

Jay : That's unnatural. I'm against it.

Claire : Oh, wow. When was the last time we talked under a table?

Gloria : Oh, surprise, surprise. Jay is against something.

Mitchell : Dad and Gloria's wedding reception.

Jay : Cam and Claire wanna have a baby together.

Claire : Oh, yeah. Um, mm... I love you. You know that... But I can't do this.
Modern Family Season 3x15 page.7

Mitchell : No, no, neither can I!
Claire : Really?
Mitchell : Yeah.

Manny : The big one, remember? One of the first ones we found. It was at the
bottom of the gutter in the street.

Claire : Are you serious? You can't... oh, God. I'm so relieved. I'm sorry. I-I-I...
ugh. I am so sorry I led us down this road.

Gloria : Ay, yes. We put the gum at the bottom of your walking stick. Ay, look
at this one... the green one, the one we found at the floor of my taxi.

Mitchell : No, no. No, Claire, don't be. Don't be. It was... it was generous and
thoughtful, just like you. How could I not want those qualities in my child?

Jay : Your taxi?

Claire : Ohh. Oh, come here.
Jay : So this is really happening?
Mitchell : What if it is, dad?
Claire : Yeah. What if we love each other, and this is a beautiful thing?
Mitchell : Okay, it's our decision. It's not yours.
Cameron : So baby? No baby?
Mitchell : No.
Mitchell : You okay?
Cameron : Oh, yeah. I'm fine.
Mitchell : Mm, I know it's been hard on you. Hey, what if we went out for a
nice dinner tonight?
Cameron : Oh, that'd be fun. Should I call the sitter?

Gloria : Yes. Before I had somebody running my life for me, I used to drive a
taxi at night. Manny would sleep in the seat next to me. One time, I had to hit
the brakes so hard that he fell into the floor and he found the penny.
Manny : Pretty lucky, huh? Eight years. I can't believe we're finally done.
Gloria : Me, either. Come. Let's go get your lottery ticket.
Jay : Gloria.
Gloria : Hmm?
Jay : I think you made a mistake here.
Gloria : What did I do now?
Jay : I counted these, and you've only got 96 pennies.
Manny : Are you sure?
Jay : Afraid so. I guess you're gonna have to keep lookin'.
Manny : Dang it! I counted those.
Jay : See for yourself.

Mitchell : Yeah. Oh, you know what I was thinking today? What about Luke?
Cameron : Oh, he's so good with her, the way he looks at her...

Cameron : And now we upload your picture.

Mitchell : My God, Cam.

Mitchell : This is fun. This is fun.

Cameorn : Oh, look, she's organizing her things.

Cameron : Yeah. And in just a few short moments, thanks to the magic of
technology... We'll know what our baby actually looks...

Mitchell : Look at how she's dressed.
Cameron : Oh! We didn't make her, but she sure is us.
Mitchell : Hey, Lily, honey, it might make more sense with the shoes...
Cameron : Mitchell.
Mitchell : Because... I like what she did with the dolls...
Cameron : Play as you will. Play as you will.
Mitchell : It's nice.

Mitchell : Oh! No!
Cameron : What happened? What is that?
Mitchell : Did you put one of us in upside-down?
Cameron : No! That's actually... Okay, I-I don't want to see this anymore. Ohh.
Turn it off.
Mitchell : Oh, it's not turning off.
Modern Family Season 3x15 page.8

Cameron : Well, throw something over it! That... oh, God!
Mitchell : Yeah, well, we played God, and look what we brought forth.
Lily : Daddies, what are you looking at? Aah!
Cameron : Oh! Maybe it wasn't that bad.
Mitchell : No, no, it's possible that we overreacted.
Cameron : Yeah. Maybe our expectations were just a little bit too high. That
little guy had some cute features. Huh?
Mitchell : Of course he did. It's us. It can't be that bad. Yeah. Let's just take...
All : Ahhh!

Modern Family Season 3x15 page.9

3x16 : Virgin Territory
Cameron : Ooh! Individual frittatas! What a treat. You're a lucky man, Phil.
Phil : I'm always saying, I'm...
Claire : Phil.
Phil : Sorry.

Luke : We used to be the cute ones. Now she gets all the attention. We need to
take her down.
Jay : And I should remember his name, too, because your mom and I got in a
big fight over him. She was using the convertible, and I told her, "put the top
up because it's supposed to rain tonight, according to..." P-p-p-partly
Mccloudy? Whatever the hell his name is. Anyway... She didn't. Ruined the
car.

Claire : You left the milk out again.

Mitchell : Well, not to be the one that always come to mom's defense... What?
It was 20 years ago. What, you think he's gonna ground you?

Phil : Oh. Mmm.

Jay : It was you?

Cameron : I may have to take one of these little guys home. Claire, did you
ever find that tupperware I lent you?

Claire : Yes. Yes, I left the top down, and I let mom take the fall.

Claire : Sweetie, for the hundredth time, I gave it back to you, remember?

Claire : 12 years later.

Cameron : I remember you telling me a hundred times, yet my pea soup is in
baggies.

Mitchell : I'm just saying.

Gloria : Did you check your car? In the...

Jay : Relax. It was years ago. There's a statute of limitation on this stuff.

Jay : Trunk.
Gloria : Because that's where you found that thing that you thought that you
gave me long time ago, the... the...

Claire : In that case, I should probably let you know I let the top down to let
out the cigarette smoke. Not... not mine. Not mine. My... my bad friend
Eleanor.

Jay : Pizza cutter. Good, give me another one.

Mitchell : Eleanor being her boyfriend Allen.

Cameron : Yes, I was wrong that time. I...

Claire : Statute of limitations.

Mitchell : It's a piece of plastic. You're ruining brunch.

Jay : Oh, relax, it's okay. Remember when I told you that I couldn't get to your
figure skating semifinal because I was stuck at work?

Jay : Don't sweat it, Cam. I forget things all the time. Like I can never
remember the name of that weather guy that I liked. Uh... Thunder something.
Stormy... Flash stormy? Ah, whatever the hell it is. I don't know.

Mitchell : And then they got divorced.

Claire : Ugh. You're ruining brunch.

Claire : Yeah.
Jay : Well, by "stuck" I meant "drunk," and by "work" I meant "the golf course."

Gloria : Mm, just eat your eggs, Jay.

Claire : Wow. Dad!

Lily : Yeah, just eat your eggs, Jay.
Jay : Oh, ho ho ho!

Mitchell : Oh, no. I got one. I got one. Remember that time we went golfing
together, and you got a hole-in-one?

Cameron : Grandpa got told!

Jay : Yeah?

Luke : Look at them. They all think Lily's so great.

Mitchell : You never got a hole-in-one. I got bored and I kicked it in the hole.

Manny : The novelty will wear off.

Phil : This is fun. Here's a corker. They didn't used to label babies as carefully
in hospitals, so for two days...
Modern Family Season 3x16 page.1

Jay : Not now, Phil. What do you mean, you... you kicked the ball in the hole?
What, was it, like, on the edge?

Phil : Did I leave that out again? I'm so sorry!

Mitchell : Yeah, it was on the edge of that, uh... What? That... that sandy thing.

Phil : Can I give you a Swedish massage, accent optional?

Jay : Gee, it's sure gonna be fun to face my friends today.

Cameron : Oh! Oh, no, I just need to lie down.

Mitchell : Well, you don't have to tell them.

Phil : Come on. Let's just get you over to the sofa.

Jay : They call me "ace," Mitch. I haven't paid for a lemonade down there in 20
years.

Cameron : Do you think it would be offensive if I asked our daughter to walk
on my back?

Mitchell : You're mad at me? Mm.

Phil : I'd say so. I just offered to give you a massage.

Lily : Great, daddy. You ruined brunch.

Lily : Oh, no! You broke Beatrice. Now she can't feed the dolphins.

Cameron : You did!

Gloria : What is she talking about?

Manny : This ends today.

Mitchell : Oh, it's a "My sweet companion" doll. They all have these elaborate
backstories. Beatrice works with blind dolphins and models.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Gloria : There are blind models? That's so sad. They cannot see how pretty
they are.

Luke : A little help here?

Phil : Okay. Hold on. Here we go. Give me some. Give me some. Give me
some. Oh! Let me buy Lily a new doll. It's my fault Cam fell.

Manny : You can't expect me to focus when Miranda Cornell lives right down
your street. She's like a dream wrapped in a wish poured into jeggings.
Luke : Yeah, yeah, that's nice and all, but we got a trap to set.
Manny : Are you sure this is going to work?
Luke : Trust me. We'll use these cookies as bait. Lily's crazy for them.
Manny : Asian metabolism.
Luke : When she grabs them with her grubby little hands, off goes the trap.
Boom... Big puddle of milk. She'll get in so much trouble. My mom hates
messes.
Manny : I'm familiar with Claire.

Cameron : Oh! My back! Ooh! My back!

Mitchell : No, no need. Uh, the My sweet companion store actually has a
hospital with an on-call doctor.
Phil : Well, I can go. I'm taking the girls to the mall anyway.
Cameron : Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. And don't worry. She has medical
insurance.
Mitchell : Yeah, and I think we've met our deductible for the year, so you
should be good.
Cameron : Yeah.
Gloria : Do you know what a doll is in my village? An apple on a fork.

Luke : Lock... and loaded. Mmm! These cookies are so good... And so easy to
reach. Lily!

Alex : I never really got dolls. Does that make me weird?

Mitchell : Oh, my God! Cam!

Haley ; It's on the list.

Cameron : Oh! Ohh!

Phil : You're not weird.

Gloria : What happened? Are you okay?

Haley : You just kind of skipped the little girl stage. And jumped to the "I dare
you to ring her doorbell" stage.

Cameron : Oh! That milk... fell, and I must have slipped in it!

Alex : The only stage you're ever going to jump on has a pole on it.
Modern Family Season 3x16 page.2

Haley : Hey, at least I have the body...
Phil : Okay! Okay! We're gonna have to settle this dispute in court... the food
court. The honorable Judge Cinnabon presiding.
Haley : The food court? That place smells like the inside of Luke's bicycle
helmet.
Alex : I like the food court.
Lily : Me, too.
Phil : Don't worry, girls. We're not gonna deprive ourselves just 'cause of
Haley's aversion to food...
Alex : Oh. Oh, Haley's "aversion." I thought you said... Never mind.
Claire : Okay, so after you have turned on the monitor and selected your
input, you can change the channel with this guy. But if you need to change the
volume...
Cameron : You know what? I think I'm fine. Why don't you just go ahead?
Claire : I know this sounds really confusing, but there's actually a very simple
way to remember it. Input 1 is the cable box cable box, ca...

Cameron : I knew for a fact Claire never returned my tupperware, I just
needed a few minutes alone to find it. And when I did, I'd never have to hear
them snicker again, "Oh, silly Cam" or "forgetful Cam," because revenge is a
dish best served cold. And even better, two days later out of 24-ounce
microwave-friendly burp-sealed pak-n-stor.
Cameron : Oh, hey! I thought you were going to the pharmacy.
Mitchell : I forgot my phone. Oh. I think I'm just upset about this stupid thing
with my dad.
Cameron : Well, sweetie, I'd love to hear about it when you come back with
my heating pad from the pharmacy, because I hurt my back, remember?
Mitchell : I mean, did he overreact or what? It's just a game, right?
Cameron : Well, unless there's something more to it. Maybe you should go talk
to him.
Mitchell : Yeah. Oh, I should have just kept my mouth shut. I mean, it was
such a great day. After he thought he got that hole-in-one, he took us out to
dinner. He bought me my first beer.

Cameron : I think I'm just gonna take a nap.

Cameron : Well, there you go. He's probably hurt because you marred a very
special father-son experience.

Claire : Okay. I'm going to yoga.

Mitchell : You think?

Gloria : Ay! That sounds like so much fun.
Cameron : Oh, you should go with her, Gloria!

Cameron : Ya marred it. But you can fix it. He's down at the club right now.
Un-mar that memory!

Claire : Oh, we should definitely do that sometime. I would love it. Bye!

Mitchell : You know what? I'm gonna do it.

Gloria : Do you see how she gives me the cold shoulders? I don't even know
why I try. Ay. Sorry.

Cameron : Ow.

Cameron : Oh, well, that's just Claire, you know? She's a Pritchett. You gotta
break through those walls. The sooner the better.

Cameron : Okay! I'll miss you! Call first.

Gloria : You really think so?
Cameron : Yeah. Why don't you go? Now. Forge that friendship!
Gloria : Okay, I go. I have my gym bag in the car. Feel better!
Cameron : Okay, thank you! I'm just gonna lie here... Some ice on my back!

Mitchell : Sorry. Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

Haley : What were you thinking saying that in front of him?
Alex : I'm sorry. It slipped out. Besides, I figured he knew.
Haley : Mom knows. Only because she dragged it out of Dylan. And she
promised not to tell dad until I left for college, which means he might have
never found out.
Alex : Stop panicking. We don't even know for sure he heard what I said.
Modern Family Season 3x16 page.3

Phil : Okay. Beatrice is with the nurse. They'll call us. Shouldn't be too long.
We can just wait until she's married. Until she's... ready. Which, apparently,
everyone is these days. Funny, I used to think it'd be years until everyone was
ready, but I guess I was wrong. Wrong and naive.

Luke : This one chickened out. For someone who says he likes girls so much,
he sure is afraid of them.
Manny : It's a dance, Luke.
Luke : Chicken dance.

Gloria : Surprise!

Cameron : Well, since you're back, what if I give you 20 bucks, and you guys...
Go wash my car?

Claire : Oh! Gloria. My God.

Luke : Is that 20 bucks for each of us, or both of us?

Gloria : I came to do yoga with you.

Cameron : Both.

Claire : I wasn't expecting to see you here.

Luke : That's what I thought.

Gloria : Yeah, that's why I say "surprise!"
Claire : Oh, yeah. This is awful, because I was just thinking I might have to
bail on yoga. I have the worst headache all of a sudden.
Gloria : Oh, but yoga is good for that, Claire. For the meditation, for the
mmm...
Claire : Yeah, yeah. It's just right now I wanna go lie down in a dark room and
breathe.
Gloria : That sounds like yoga.
Claire : I... I realize that. Yes. But still, I-I... should go.
Gloria : Come on. I'm not gonna do the class by myself. Okay, so let's go and
get massages. Or there's a nail salon there.
Claire : Ooh, I would love to do that some other time, I really would. But right
now I need to get home and lie down. You understand, right?
Gloria : Of course.
Claire : Okay.
Gloria : You go! And lie.
Manny : You're better!
Cameron : Oh! Barely. Barely, yeah. I was just getting something cold for my
back.
Luke : Gravy? Well, if it can save your mom's turkey, it can save anything. I
thought you were going to see your friend Miranda.

Stan : Uh-oh, check it out. Ace is drooling over his plaque again.
Jay : Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't smell you idiots come in. Listen, I've been thinking,
maybe it's time we retire the name "Ace."
Miles : You mean the name you had printed on your golf cap?
Stan : And his robe.
Jay : You know, guys, about that...
Frank : Remember how mad he got when I yanked that cap off his head and
put it on?
Miles : You got to earn that!
Jay : Yeah, yeah, well, I'm just glad one of those cheap hair plugs didn't get
caught in it.
Frank : Hey, for the millionth time, they're not plugs.
Stan : So what, your hair just came back when you turned 50?
Frank : Unlike your wife.
Stan : Hey, that was a blessing. Otherwise, I wouldn't be taking out Natalie
Hobbes tonight.
Miles : Taking her out or doing her taxes?
Jay : So I'm trying to find a way to come clean about the hole-in-one, when it
occurs to me... Why? One idiot lies about his sex life, the other dumbbell has a
Ferrari "in the shop" for years, and moron number three is a Hollywood stunt
car driver who gets sick when he rides backwards in the golf cart.
Modern Family Season 3x16 page.4

Jay : So you ladies ready to tee off or what?

Luke : We got a full tank of gas, and she's right down the block. Now buckle
up!

Frank : Yeah, just gotta settle up our tab.

Manny : Are you crazy?

Jay : I took care of it.

Luke : You tell me.

Miles : You said you were going to the restroom.
Stan : Ah! Can't trust a word out of this guy's mouth.

Alex : Lily, what is this? Don't you rather have a chemistry set or flash cards?

Frank : 20 years we've been falling for this.

Lily : She's pretty.

Mitchell : I-I'm sorry to interrupt, but my dad never lied to you guys.

Alex : No. No, she's dirty. Look. Look at the dirt. Let me wipe her off. Fix that.
One of her breeds is coming loose. Come here. Fix that right up.

Jay : Mitchell...
Mitchell : No, he didn't even know until today that he never made the hole-inone.

Dr Goodall : So I've completed the examination, she did really well.

Jay : Okay.

Phil : What's the prognosis?

Mitchell : But the fact that he couldn't live with himself when he found out,
and he raced down here to confess to you, that just shows the kind of man he
is. He is a hole-in-one kind of man.

Dr Goodall : We can fix most of her arm, but she'll never regain full mobility
in her shoulder joint, because they don't make that part anymore.

Stan : You never got a hole-in-one?
Jay : I didn't tell them.
Mitchell : So this is the gang. Introduce me.
Luke : Ahh. Score!
Manny : It's not like me and Miranda are perfectly suited. For one thing, she
likes bad boys. That's just not me.

Haley : Well, that's pretty good, right? I mean, she'll look exactly the same. No
one will know.
Phil : I'll know. I'm just saying I liked her the way she was. She was such a
sweet little doll. I'm sorry, doctor. I'm having trouble adjusting to all this.
Haley : Uh, dad, she's still a sweet little doll.
Phil : No, she's broken.
Haley : No, she's just changed a little. It happens. Dolls grow up.
Dr Goodall : Well, actually...

Luke : I'm gonna turn on some music.

Haley : Uh, could you...

Manny : I'm sorry. I can't unlearn how to treat a lady. But where does that
leave me? Waiting till I'm 40 when she looks me up on Facebook after a failed
first marriage?

Dr Goodall : Yeah. Sure. I actually have to go give a little girl some pretty bad
news.
Phil : So, Haley... The thing is...

Luke : Okay.
Manny : What are you doing?
Luke : I'm sick of hearing you whine about Miranda! It's time to make her
notice you!
Manny : But we can't!

Phil : Fact... Haley's almost 18. Fact... I am the cool dad. Haley, I understand
that sex is a part of life. I can't say that I'm thrilled to hear this, but I'm sure
you're being safe, and I hope that you'll feel free to talk to me about this
anytime.

Modern Family Season 3x16 page.5

Phil : We should... We should probably get Beatrice, like, a-a cast or
something, and we can all sign it. Yeah?

Gloria : I have to go. Hola, Claire!

Haley : Uh, yeah. Sure.

Gloria : Were you going back to the yoga class without me?

Claire : Gloria, you've gotta stop doing that!
Claire : No, that is not why I came back.

Phil : Fact... I blew it.
Phil : This repair's probably gonna take a little while. Why don't you run up to
the food court and grab us a table? I'll get Alex and Lily.

Gloria : I don't understand you. Why you don't want to spend time with me?
Everybody wants to spend time with me! Even the lady that did my nails
wants to take me to pilates.

Haley : Okay. Do you want the counter or a booth?

Claire : I didn't come back here to do yoga. I don't do yoga. It's a cover, okay?
Look... I know that from the outside, it seems like I have everything together.

Phil : Whatever seems right to you. I trust you.

Gloria : No, not really.

Haley : I have a cool dad.
Luke : Okay. Your turn.
Manny : Unh-unh! No way!
Luke : Do you wanna get her attention, or not?
Manny : That was amazing! Did you see the look on Miranda's face?
Luke : No. But you did good, Thelma.
Manny : Please stop calling me that. I hate that movie.
Luke : What movie?
Manny : Uh-oh! Dead end!
Luke : You gotta make a u-ey.
Manny : I don't know how to do that.
Gloria : She pretended to have a headache, Cam. She doesn't want to spend
time with me.
Cameron : Maybe she just wanted to be alone.
Gloria : Why?
Cameron : Because some people really value their privacy, and you have to
respect that.

Claire : My point is that my life can be very stressful. And I have found a way
to cope with that stress. And it's my little secret. And I'm not proud of it.
Claire's friend : Hey, Claire. See you inside.
Claire : Hey!
Gloria : Is that what you do?
Claire : No. No! Okay. You're coming with me. Come in. But listen to me.
Gloria... It has to stay between us. This is my sacred space.
Claire : It's just such a great release. Thank you for not judging me.
Gloria : Why would I? If anything, it makes me like you more.
Claire : Mm.
Gloria : So how often do you come here?
Claire : Not that often. No. Hey. Maybe a little often.
Gloria : That's so sad.
Claire : I live with four teenagers.
Gloria : You live with two adults.
Claire : You have no idea...
Gloria : No, no, no. It's so sad that you come here so often and that's the best
that you can shoot. And that's with pretty nails.
Claire : But improper stance. I...
Gloria : Practice more.
Modern Family Season 3x16 page.6

Claire : Okay.

Phil : Yes, you can get the doll. You can get as many dolls as you want.
Alex : It's $200.

Waiter : Here you go, Ace... I mean... what is your real name?

Phil : Or one is fine.

Jay : Jay.

Cameron : I know you're here. Hello.

Mitchell : Dad, I...

Manny : I have a bad feeling about this. What if one of your neighbors saw us?
Maybe we should just confess.

Jay : I told you, forget about it.
Mitchell : All right. I-I just want you to know I get why you're upset, okay?
That... that day you got the hole-in-one, it meant a lot to you. And... I... I
marred it. But it meant a lot to me, too. We had a steak dinner, you gave me
my first beer, and, uh... It was one of the greatest days we ever spent together.
And it wasn't about some meaningless hole-in-one, it was about us.

Luke : We will... In 20 years.
Manny : Huh?
Luke : You heard grandpa. There's a statute of limitations, which is a good
thing because we still need to take Lily down.

Jay : No. It was about a hole-in-one.

Manny : Nah, let her be the cute one. We don't need that anymore. We're bad
boys now.

Mitchell : Yes. Yes. A-a little bit, maybe. But mostly, it was about how we
bonded.

Luke : Yeah. I like that. Bad boys.

Jay : I thought I hit a ball straight from the tee really, really far into a tiny hole.
Mitchell : Okay. Well, when will I learn?
Jay : And it wasn't your first beer, anyway.
Mitchell : Yes, it was, dad, but I wouldn't expect you to remember.
Jay : It was your 14th birthday. You asked me for a sip of mine. Your mom
yelled at you in front of all your friends, said you were just a baby. You ran
outside in tears... Which, unfortunately, supported your mom's argument.
Anyway, I came out with a couple of beers. We drank 'em on the porch
watching the storm clouds coming in.

Manny : Your mom!
Gloria : Oh, my God. Cam!
Cameron : Um, this had a lid?
Haley : I'll see you guys later. I'm going to Abby's.
Claire : Bye, honey. Have fun.
Phil : Have fun, you! With Abby! We've confirmed Abby's a real person and a
female?
Claire : Yes, sweetie. We met her. Honey, we can't treat Haley differently just
because we both know what we know about her.

Mitchell : I had completely forgotten about that. You know, you're... you're
unbelievable. Just when I peg you as some...

Phil : I know. I just need time. So Dylan told you? Why didn't he tell me? He
and I used to share everything.

Jay : Storm Stevens! That's it! Give me something. I'm gonna write it right
here. Before I forget. "Storm Stevens." Stevens. What were we just talking
about? Just now? No?

Claire : You're upset about a lot of things.

Mitchell : Mnh-mnh.

Claire : Three months.

Haley : Come on, Lily. Let's see if Beatrice is ready.

Phil : So this giant thing happened to our first born, and you kept me in the
dark about it for three whole months?

Alex : Hey, dad? I know I'm way too old for this, but do you think I could get
this doll? Her name's Genevieve, and she's developing a vaccine for...

Phil : Okay, I won't obsess over it. I just wanna ask you one thing. How long
have you known?

Claire : I'm sorry. I just wasn't sure how you'd... Okay.
Phil : Thank you.
Modern Family Season 3x16 page.7

3x17 : Leap Day
Cameron : I'm 10!
Phil : Come on, boys! It's leap day, not sleep day!

Mitchell : 40!

Phil : I love leap day!

Cameron : I was born February 29th, and there have been ten of those... In my
lifetime, therefore I'm 10! It's fun.

Claire : It's kind of a big deal in the Dunphy house. This year, we even got
Manny involved.

Mitchell : It's so much fun. Anyway, I-I've spent the last four years trying to
figure to what kind of party to throw this one.

Phil : You're given this gift of 24 extra hours. You can't waste it at work or
school. You have to do something extraordinary, something shocking.

Cameron : Oh, honey, you know I'd be fine with just a nice casual evening at
home with you.

Claire : Mm. This year, the entire family is taking a trapeze class.

Mitchell : Don't... don't even. No. No! That's what he said last time.

Phil : How extraordinary is that?
Claire : It was my idea.
Phil : How shocking is that?
Claire : I can be spontaneous every four years.
Phil : I can't wait.
Gloria : Leap day is stupid.
Jay : You're not understanding the logic behind it. A year is actually 365.25
days. Every four years, we gain one day. If we didn't adjust the calendar in,
say, 40 years, February would almost be January.

Mitchell : Okay, birthday boy, what's it gonna be... rom com or horror? Or we
can do both and watch "maid in Manhattan." Whatcha doing?
Cameron : Canceling our baby.
[OPENING CREDITS]
Cameron : Okay, love to dad. Bye! Mwah!
Lily : Daddy, what are you doing?

Gloria : That's not my problem, and it's definitely not your problem.

Mitchell : Yeah, daddy, what are you doing? Snooping for hints about your
birthday? Wow.

Jay : Look at this. The housekeeper turned another one of my whites pink. I
can't wear this to a sports bar.

Cameron : No, I... come on. No, I'm just excited, and I wanna be helpful. I
know party planning isn't your thing.

Gloria : Mm, they're to going to be looking at you, Jay.

Lily : Wow.

Jay : Somebody's feeling pretty good about herself.

Mitchell : Y-you need to trust me, cam.

Gloria : They're going to be watching the match.

Cameron : I know, and I do. It's not like you're gonna do anything tired, like
appletinis or ice sculptures. Or synthetic napkins or anything mylar.

Jay : You meant you a little bit.
Mitchell : Okay, put it in there. All right, very quietly, we're gonna go to
daddy's bedroom, open the door, and... Aah!
Cameron : Happy Birthday to me.

Mitchell : Cam, that's enough! I've been paying for your last party for four
years. And I find it a little insulting that you don't think I can pull this off.
Cameron : You know what? I trust you. I'm letting go.
Mitchell : Okay.
Cameron : Okay? You know orange is over, right?
Modern Family Season 3x17 page.1

Mitchell : It's a simple party. I can do it.

Haley : It's not fair.

Cameron : Simple. Perfect.

Claire : I know. Oh, no! It's sad.
Luke : Oh, my God. They're gonna ruin everything.

Mitchell : Yeah, just a simple party. I'm simply taking Cam's favorite movie,
"The Wizard of Oz," and turning our house into an Oz-themed extravaganza...
yellow brick carpet, waitstaff in full costume, and custom-made Ruby slippers
for Cam. Whazzup?!
Manny : So is this safe?
Luke : It's a trapeze.
Phil : Relax. More people are killed by knife-wielding strangers than from
trapezing.
Manny : I'm thinking about going home now.
Phil : Honey, are you okay?
Claire : I'm fine. I'm watching... It's so sad.
Phil : Oh, no. Not today.
Luke : What's wrong?
Phil : Nothing. No, your mom's just, uh... Feeling emotional.
Luke : She was like this last month and the month before and the month
before.
Haley ; What?! I could kill someone! No, I can't hear you! This stupid phone
gets no reception in this stupid house! Aah!
Phil : Dear God, no.

Phil : No. We... we just need to be extra sensitive.
Claire : Phil, honey, when do we need to leave?
Phil : Whenever's good for you, sweetie. Maybe 20 minutes?
Alex : 20 minutes?!
Claire : Then which one is it, Phil?
Haley : Is it whenever it's good for me or is it 20 minutes?!
Phil : Whenever you're ready!
Phil : It happened... Satan's trifecta. The day I most dreaded has fallen on the
day I most loved.
Luke : They're gonna ruin trapezing. I bet they don't even catch me.
Manny : Why are you so afraid of them? They're reasonable. Why don't we
just suggest they stay home, considering they're all on their menst...
Phil : Shh! The first rule of dealing with the cycle... you never mention the
cycle. You tiptoe around it. The woman's actually taken great pains to hide the
monster she's become. But if you acknowledge it, that brings the monster
forth.
Luke : My God. And there's three of them.
Phil : It's okay. I have a plan. It's kind of traditional for people to lean in when
somebody says, "I have a plan." Okay...

Phil : I'd heard rumors. Yeah, we all had, that females living or working in
close quarters could eventually get on the same... cycle. But I always assumed
that was a story designed to keep women out of submarine corps.

Jorgen : Ja! Ja! Ja! Ja! Ooh! No!

Alex : This isn't milk. What's wrong with me today? My brain's not working
right.

Jorgen : Ja, because we are never going to win. You said that a billion times.
Just go home.

Phil : No.

Gloria : Why don't you Dutch people go home?

Alex : I can't focus... Three legs?

Jorgen : Someone should shut your Colombian mouth!

Gloria : Si! Si! Si! Si! Goal! Goal! You should call your country "the neverlands" because you're never...

Modern Family Season 3x17 page.2

Gloria : Okay, I wanna see you try!

Mitchell : Oh, no! W-what is Cam doing home?

Jay : Uh, is there a problem over here?

Monkey men : Hey. We're the monkeys.

Jorgen : Yes. There is a problem, and you're married to her.

Mitchell : Yes, hi. Hi. Come on inside. Quickly, quickly. Hi. Okay, one second.

Jay : Really? Well, let me make a suggestion. Why don't you sit down, I send
you over a beer, my wife and I watch from over there? That way, everybody
enjoys the game... except me, 'cause I prefer a game where something happens.
Gloria, let's go. Let's go.

Mitchell : Hey! Whatcha doing home? Are you checking on me and the party
again?

Jay : Ah, I got 60 pounds on the kid.

Cameron : No, no. I left my cell phone in your car and I gotta be in touch with
mama today. She's talking to the insurance agency for the first time to see if
they're gonna rebuild grandpa's farm.

Gloria : Yeah. It's just that I've heard so many stories about you fighting.

Mitchell : Rebuild the... Because of the tornado.

Gloria : I thought you were going to punch that guy back there.

Jay : And... it's not worth the trouble.
Gloria : Yeah, and he has all those friends and...
Jay : Well, his friends had nothing to do with it. I mean, sometimes it's better to
take the high road.

Mitchell : I totally missed the connection. A month after the most devastating
twister to ever hit Cam's hometown, I throw a party based on gay cinema's
most famous tornado.

Gloria : Yeah, it's better that you walked away.
Jay : Gloria, I get... I get the impression you're disappointed I didn't punch that
guy.
Gloria : Of course not. Who needs all that manly, protect-your-woman stuff?
Jay : No, see, like, right there. You're saying one thing, but it feels like you
mean the opposite.

Cameron : Yeah, you know, it's been a month, and she hasn't heard anything,
and she's just beside herself. And then you know what else? Lily succumbed
to her injuries.
Mitchell : Your aunt Lily died?
Cameron : No, the family pig.

Gloria : No.

Mitchell : Aunt Lily was a... We named our daughter after a pig?

Jay : That's a "yes."

Cameron : Could you just witness my pain instead of criticizing? I just want to
be in touch with my family today, get all this tornado stuff behind me so I can
enjoy... the fabulous party you're planning for me!

Gloria : Look, Jay, I just came to watch the game. I don't want to fight.
Jay : Neither do I.
Gloria : I know.
Party planner : So in keeping with the film, this area will be in black and
white, and then an explosion of technicolor. Best part... as the guests are
coming in... Auntie em! Auntie em! A simulated tornado.
Mitchell : Yeah. Oh, he's gonna love that.
Party planner : So the appletinis are canceled... Yes. The little Toto dog is
ordered, and... Please tell me that you are not mixing punch in costume!

Mitchell : Yeah! You gotta get outta here! Okay. Hey, listen. Hey, Cam?
Cameron : Yeah?
Mitchell : You just call your family, tell them I said "hi." And don't worry
about being back at 6:00 on the dot. There's a little breathing room.
Cameron : Oh, what, are you kidding me?
Mitchell : Mnh-mnh.
Cameron : The sooner I can start to party, the sooner I can start to forget.

Modern Family Season 3x17 page.3

Mitchell : But then again, hey, if you keep running from every reminder of the
tornado, doesn't the tornado win?

Claire : Mm.

Cameron : Mitchell, my grandpa runs to his pickup truck every morning
because he thinks the pitchfork is gonna come back down. The tornado always
wins.

Haley : Try looking under the one you have one.

Mitchell : Okay, well, it's gonna be so much fun tonight!
Cameron : I know! The big 1-0!
Mitchell : 4-0!
Cameron : Hey, Mitchell!
Mitchell : I'm over here! But you didn't!
Cameron : I could've hit you!
Mitchell : I'm doing my "I love ya" dance. Okay, I'm doing my "I love you" car
dance.
Cameron : Look at you!
Mitchell : I do the best moves!
Cameron : Stop that!
Mitchell : Okay! Go! I got... this is dangerous. Okay, okay. Go. Get out of here,
you. Out!
Cameron : It's my birthday!
Mitchell : All right, guys, come here. We need to talk.
Manny : There they are.
Haley : Stop rushing us!
Phil : Buddy, what's wrong?
Manny : Yes, you've been a little off all morning.
Luke : I've been feeling a lot of stress lately. My head's all foggy, and I'm kind
of emotional.

Alex : I can't find my other sock!
Alex : I am not you. I don't do that. See? Oh, God, I am you.
Claire : Would you mind if we sat out trapezing?
Phil : Really?
Claire : Yeah.
Phil : Are you sure? Okay.
Claire : Why does he do that? Every month. Yeah, I get a little moody, but
unrelenting physical discomfort will do that to a person. Doesn't he know that
tiptoeing around someone like they're crazy makes them crazy?
Claire : All right, you and Manny go ahead. Luke can just stay here with us.
Luke : Wait. What?
Phil : Luke's actually looking better.
Luke : I am better.
Claire : Well, let's not take any chances. He can stay here. You go ahead.
Luke : Dad?
Phil : Um, I...
Luke : Daddy?
Phil : See you later, buddy.
Manny : What are we going to do?
Phil : We leave no man behind.
Manny : I think I'm just gonna go home.

Phil : Oh. Well, I sure hope you feel better soon 'cause you really need your
wits about you when you're trapezing.

Scarecrow : We have time. Just take down the decorations and have a normal
party.

Claire : This is weird because the three of us haven't exactly been feeling our
best today either.

Mitchell : Yeah, and throw a boring party in our house that looks like I just
threw it together this afternoon? Think!

Phil : Really?
Modern Family Season 3x17 page.4

Party planner : Okay, we have a few options. I can get you the back room at
Amelia's.

crossing the street with Dede, and some jackass almost clipped her. I had the
guy on the ground, my foot on his neck, before the car stopped moving.

Mitchell : Spilled juice on the owner's white rug and almost killed her toddler.
Next.

Manny : Yeah, we've heard all those stories. Maybe my mom wouldn't mind a
glimpse of that Jay. That's her. She wants me to help pick out Cam's gift.

Micky : Bowling alley?

Jay : I'm still that guy, you know. 100%. What the hell? How do you cut your
finger on a cracker? Anyway, if I thought there was a fight worth fighting, I'd
fight it. Ow! Now I got salt in this. That stings!

Mitchell : Not classy enough. What have you got?
Scarecrow : Uh...
Mitchell : You're no help. You.
Davy : Well, last weekend, I did a party on a boat.
Micky : You said you were visiting your parents.
Davy : Shh! You're suffocating me.
Mitchell : What's this boat? Tell me about the boat.
Party planner : Okay, we did an elegant dinner party on a luxury yacht for
about 25 people. It takes you around the harbor, dancing under the moonlight.
Mitchell : Okay, okay. Uh, maybe we can... we can make a theme out of this.
You know, Cam's life is like a long voyage. Sometimes choppy but... but
always forward, ever forward.
Party planner : We have two hours.
Mitchell : Book it.
Jay : Hey, you survived trapeze class, huh?
Manny : Didn't happen, and common decency prevents me from telling you
why. How was the soccer match?

Gloria : Next time, don't scream at your boss so that he doesn't make you
work during the weekends. And you can come to see your son! Si. Adios.
Manny : Hey, mom. Who were you yelling at?
Gloria : Your father, baby. He cannot make it this weekend.
Gloria : Okay, I admit it. I wanted Jay to kick that little Dutch man's ass at the
bar. But two seconds on the phone with Javier, and I remember what that
stupid hothead behavior gets you... Nothing. It's better to be calm like Jay. Like
Jay and me. Like Jay.
Phil : I'm back! Wouldn't you know, I forgot my ding-dang sunglasses. Luke,
could you give me a hand?
Claire : What were the chances that Phil had come back to apologize for all the
game playing and have an open conversation with me about what I was
feeling?

Jay : Thrilling. 1-1 tie. One of the goals was an accident.
Manny : I'm sure my mom was happy you went.
Jay : I don't know what to make of her today. She got into it with this guy, and
I swear she was pushing me into a fight with him. Now is that something
she'd want?
Manny : I don't know. I always thought of women as the more evolved sex.
But after today... I've seen things, Jay.
Jay : 'Cause, you know, I had my share of fights in my time. You know that.
Mmm! Mm. Mm. It's too warm for me. Yeah, I remember this time I was

Phil : Okay, I got a bottle of fake blood out of the Halloween supplies. Put a
dab on your finger, say you cut it. I say I need to run you by the doctor. Easy
trapezy. Got it?
Luke : See ya on the other side, brother.
Claire : Just once, I would like Phil to have a little empathy, give me some
sense that he understands what women go through.

Modern Family Season 3x17 page.5

Phil : You feeling any better?
Claire : Mnh-mnh.
Phil : Hate to see the whole team on the D.L.
Luke : Ow! My finger!
Phil : I don't like the sound of that. I said a little bit!
Luke : The cap fell off. I decided to just go with it.
Phil : Okay, we gotta get you out the back.
Alex : God, what happened?!
Phil : Oh, it's just a little cut. But to be safe, I'll run him by the doctor.
Haley : No, are you crazy?! Call 9-1-1!
Phil : No, no, they're so busy.
Haley : Where's the wound?! We need to put pressure on it, right?
Alex : I'm gonna be sick!
Haley : My... my finger.
Alex : Oh, he needs a tourniquet! Where do I put it?!
Luke : On my finger.
Claire : Stop! There is nothing wrong with h.. Luke, what's going on?
Luke : I cut my finger? Dad?
Phil : How crazy is that? They were in my pocket the whole time. I'll see you.
Claire : Phil!
Claire : What is going on, Luke?
Luke : Dad staged the whole thing so we could go on the trapeze without you
three.
Claire : Why?

Claire : Phil! Is this what you've been teaching our son? That... that women are
some kind of unclean lepers that should be hidden away under sheets for a
week? Do you have any idea how offensive that is?
Phil : I do, honey. And from the bottom of my heart, I am so... S-s-scared.
Alex : Ugh!
Claire : Oh, my.
Mitchell : Okay. 3, 2, 1!
Everybody : Surprise!
Cameron : Oh, my gosh! Oh, it's amazing!
Mitchell : Yeah, it's a boat party.
Cameron : Oh! Because?
Mitchell : Your life is like a voyage.
Cameron : Oh! Well, everyone's is, but I love it because none of our other
friends have ever done it.
Phil : Aw. That's so sweet.
Claire : Oh, it must be easy with no dirty, broken woman in the relationship.
Alex : What are you laughing at?
Mitchell : Okay, everybody follow the birthday flag!
Cameron : What'd you call me? Oh. Uh, oh, yes. Oh, my gosh. It's so elegant.
I'll bet Pepper is dying.
Mitchell : Oh, you know, actually, Pepper couldn't come because he hates
boats. You know, after the Navy.
Cameron : Yeah. Oh, yeah. I guess longinus got over his fear of... of water?

Luke : Because... B-because... Because of this! You're all monster-ating!

Mitchell : No, no. Why don't we just focus on the 30 people who are here,
having a great time!

Phil : Luke, no!

Gloria : Ew! It smells like somebody's dead.

Alex : Are you kidding me?!

Alex : Ugh! What is that smell?

Haley : Oh, my God!
Claire : Oh, my lord.

Mitchell : That faint odor is... is a tiny, tiny blue whale who apparently has
indeed died, uh, nearby. But...

Luke : Sorry! I know you told me not to say it, but I...

Gloria : Si, but it's getting all over my coat.
Modern Family Season 3x17 page.6

Phil : I don't smell anything. Maybe that's because you smell like a bouquet of
flowers.

Captain : Look, I can't fit more than 30 people on the boat, as I was just
explaining to the lady here.

Claire : Oh, yeah. Watch out for that.

Jay : Well, first of all, that "lady" is my son.

Luke : Ugh! It smells like puke married poop and had the ceremony in my
nose.

Mitchell : He wasn't talking about me.

Manny : You paint with words.

Jay : Oh. Her. Oh, it's "her" now. Well, "her" happens to be my wife. You got a
problem with her, you got a problem with me.

Mitchell : Okay, don't worry, everybody. Soon we'll be way, way out at sea,
bouncing on the waves with all of his sweet-smelling brothers and sisters.
Okay?
Captain : Mitchell Pritchett?
Mitchell : Oh, yes. Hi.
Captain : Hi. I'm your captain tonight. We've got a problem. I can't fit this
many people on my boat.
Mitchell : No, no. I was... I was told you could take 30. I have exactly 30
guests.
Captain : Plus six in help. You gotta drop a few people.
Mitchell : Come on. There... there must be something that we can do here.
Captain : Well, we have bigger boats, but this is the best I could do on two
hours' notice.

Captain : I was talking about her.

Gloria : No, no, Jay...
Jay : You know...
Gloria : Calm down.
Captain : I didn't have a problem before, but now I'm starting to.
Jay : No, your problem's about to get a lot bigger.
Gloria : No, Jay, I know you think this is what I want, but it's not.
Jay : I've got this, Gloria.
Gloria : No, Jay. I was just being stupid today. I like that you're calm, that you
think first, and you act second. I need that in my life.
Captain : Yeah, so walk away, grandpa.
Jay ; You know what?

Gloria : : Please, um... What is the problem?

Gloria : Nobody call him "grandpa"!

Cameron : Apparently, Mitchell started planning my birthday party two hours
ago.

Luke : I do.

Mitchell : Mnh-mnh. No. No, I-I did not. Uh, apparently, we have too many
people for his boat. So...

Captain : Okay, that's it! No boat! Everybody off my dock, or I'm calling the
cops!
Cameron : Wait, w-wait. So no party now?

Gloria : That's crazy. I've seen more people clinging to a floating door.

Mitchell : No! No, of course! Just... Just... just give me a minute okay?

Captain : I'm sorry, lady. It's a safety issue.

Cameron : Oh, we, after what you did with two hours, I can't wait to see what
you do with a minute.

Gloria : Oh, no. You're going to have a safety issue if you don't take me away
from this whale.

Mitchell : Cam!

Captain : Okay, little too much finger, little too much attitude.
Jay : What's all this?

Phil : Poor Cam. He seems so upset.

Cameron : Uh, two hours of Mitchell's hard work going down the drain.

Claire : Oh, is that hard for you, Phil, that he's have a feeling around you?
Haley : I'm so sorry.
Modern Family Season 3x17 page.7

Alex : Too many emotions?
Phil : Okay, okay, I give up! Yeah, I made a mistake today. But only because
the three of you ganged up on me like when the wolfman, Dracula, and
frankenstein show up in the same movie, except this wasn't awesome! I have
been on an emotional roller coaster all day today. I'm afraid. I'm mad. I'm mad
because I'm afraid, and now I can't even think straight because I'm in so much
pain from what just happened over there! And the whole thing makes me so
sad, and I'm not even sure why, and I'm nauseous from that smell but I'm so
hungry.
Claire : Yeah.
Mitchell : Cam, the... the boat wasn't even part of the plan.
Cameron : No, it's fine. It's my fault for letting my expectations get too high.
I'll get over this one, too.
Mitchell : No, no. I had this whole "Wizard of Oz" party planned, only today I
realized that it might be a-a little too tornado-y.
Cameron : Today?
Mitchell : Yes! I'm sorry I-I didn't make the connection, okay? Probably 'cause
I've been planning for months so that you could have the perfect party and be
happy, which now I don't even think is possible.

Mitchell : Oh, w...stop it. Come on. How... how can you say that? You're...
you're a wonderful father. You... You... you graduated from clown college.
You've been to France.
Cameron : I don't want to be 40. It's not fair!
Phil : I know. Nothing's fair. 2 Miles from here is an amusement park full of
happy families swinging on a trapeze. That's all I wanted for my special bonus
day.
Cameron : What?
Mitchell : I'd been trying so hard to figure out what Cam wanted for his
birthday. He'd been telling me all along. He wanted to be 10.
Phil : Seriously? There's nothing you can do?
Trapeze guy : I'm sorry. You just missed the cutoff. How about we see you next
time?
Claire : How about you make an exception and strap him in there?
Haley : Yeah, we're, like, ten minutes past your deadline, anyway.
Alex : And you don't want to make us angry today.
Trapeze guy : Ladies, uh, I really can't make any exceptions.

Cameron : Oh, I'm sorry that I would like to have a nice 10th birthday party.

Claire : "Ladies"?

Mitchell : Well, you can't have it, Cam! You wanna know why?! Because
you're 40! You're a 40-year-old man!

Alex : Seriously, Pete?
Haley : No, I don't think "ladies"...

Cameron : I am 40. I'm 40.
Mitchell : Yes. Oh, Cam, stop it.

Phil : And that was how they apologized to me.

Cameron : I'm 40 and I'm... I'm on this stupid... wait, what is that?! Oh, it's
this... Thing!

Haley : Whoo!

Mitchell : Suddenly, it all made sense. Cam's craziness all day wasn't about a
party. It was about turning 40. And once he realized that, everything got much
worse.

Claire : Come on, Phil!
Alex : Oh, oh, oh, oh! Ohh!
Claire : Oh, God, Phil!
Haley : Aah! You did it!
Cameron : I've done nothing with my life!
Modern Family Season 3x17 page.8

Phil : At least, I-I think it was. I could never ask them.
Claire : This is so satisfying!
Alex : Best I've felt all day!
Phil : Can I rent one of these on a monthly basis?
Mitchell : Ohh, ha ha! Yes! Oh, yay!
Cameron : Best 40th birthday party ever.
Mitchell : No, no. 10th.
Cameron : Really?
Mitchell : Yeah. In fact, you're still that sexy little 8 year old I fell in love with.
Cameron : Oh, um...
Mitchell : No, just go.

Modern Family Season 3x17 page.9

3x18 : Send Out The Clowns
Cameron : This week, the world lost a great man, and I lost a mentor. For
nearly 60 years, Professor ringmaster Al Uzielli helped young hopefuls like me
find their clown persona.

Haley : Please don't. We got her request the first time, but ignored it. I can't
have her on there snooping around seeing what I'm doing at parties.
Alex : Or posting pictures of us on family vacations wearing old, dorky
clothes. What? What's wrong with this?

Mitchell : "Professor ringmaster"?
Cameron : It's a very prestigious title at clown college. One step below
piemaster general.

Luke : Dad, check it out. I made one giant oreo.
Phil : Luke, what are you doing? You gotta eat it like it's an ear of corn.
Luke : Genius.

Chuckleberry : Where's Lewis?

Phil : Aw.

Cameron : Who knows?

Claire : Wow. New suit?

Chuckleberry : Okay, guys, it's just us. Lift on three.

Phil : New everything. Kids, gather 'round. It's time for a life lesson.
Haley : Aren't we already gathered?

[OPENING CREDITS]

Phil : Let me tell you something. Hard work, determination, and perseverance
always win out. I am living proof that nice guys can finish first.

Claire : Hey, how come you guys haven't accepted my friend requests?
Haley : I didn't know you were on Facebook.

Phil : Today I have a chance to get the biggest listing of my career.

Alex : Yeah. You said it was only for teenagers and people looking to have
affairs.

Claire : Oh, I have never seen this man so focused.

Claire : Well, I figured if you can't fight it... Not the having the affair. That's
still bad. No. Not that, but there's nothing wrong with catching up with a few
old friends, right? Or doing a little social networking with by B.F.F.s?
Luke : Social networking or social not-working?
Claire : Oh! You know what we gotta do? We gotta get a picture of us all
together on a boat. I think that's a thing now. So what do you say? Accept my
friend thingy.

Phil : I'm like a boxer before the big fight. That's why I didn't have sex with
Claire last night. Sorry, honey.
Claire : Mm. It's... it's okay.
Phil : But as soon as I get this listing... ding!
Claire : Let's just stop. Stop.
Gloria : I see you.

Alex : Sorry, mom, I-I didn't get a friend thingy from you.

Jay : What? I'm scratching.

Haley : Yeah, you know, they have a lot of blocks on there to protect kids from
weirdos.

Manny : Hey, mom? Is it okay if I have a friend come over tomorrow?

Claire : Mm. Okay. Good, good. I'll send it again.

Manny : It's Griffin Cooper.

Haley : Great.

Jay : Griffin Cooper?

Gloria : Who? Reuben? Or the nervous one that gets the nosebleed?

Alex : Please do.
Modern Family Season 3x18 page.1

Jay : Griffin Cooper is, by far, the coolest kid in Manny's grade. He's a terrific
athlete, he's confident. Manny's a great kid, sure, but he's not exactly cool. He
can't even open a door cool.

Phil : Mitzi Roth... a notorious poacher in the world of high-end residential
real estate. We call her the "nightmare on elm street," because she sold a lot of
houses on elm street.

Manny : Salutations, Wyatt. I'm so glad you're joining me for an afternoon of
mirth. Ah, good evening, Reuben-San. May I ask you to remove your shoes?
Tonight, we are going Japanese. Ah! Hebalaboo ridabeley lai mubay rumboo. I
invented a new language this morning.

Phil : What are you doing here, Mitzi? I have an appointment. This is my
listing.

Jay : When did you guys become buddies? Was it a football game in the yard?
You made a great catch?
Manny : No, that didn't happen. But the librarian told me one day I'll be a
great catch.
Jay : I'm really not getting that relationship.
Gloria : Why can't you just be happy that Manny's making new friends?
Jay : No. 'Cause it doesn't add up. Cool kids like Griffin Cooper... they don't
hang out with kids like Manny.
Gloria : Manny's very cool. Maybe those kids are finally catching up to him.
Jay : Wait a minute. I get it. Couple of days last week, I took Manny to school
on my motorcycle. Griffin must think I'm pretty boss.
Gloria : Yes, Jay. It's all because of you.
Jay : Kids are looking for role models. Why do you think fonzie was so
popular?

Mitzi : Oh, I didn't think that was dotted line yet, jazz hands. No worries. I
may have an interested buyer. I'll bring him to you.
Phil : Really? Okay, but could you come back later? I really need to have them
to myself right now.
Mitzi : Oh, yeah, okay. I completely understand.
Phil : Okay, thanks.
Mitzi : You're welcome.
Phil : Wait. What? What are you doing?
Mitzi : Watch this.
Stan : Hello?
Mitzi : Oh, it's Mitzi Roth.
Phil : And Phil Dunphy.
Mitzi : I may have a prospective buyer for your beautiful house. I was
wondering if maybe I could come in...
Phil : Hey, Stan! Hey, Patti!
Mitzi : And just have a look for a little while.

Gloria : He told people that they were rich, but really took their money with
his scheme?

Phil : We've got a lot to talk about.

Jay : No, that's a... Yes. Those people were victims of a fonzie scheme.

Phil : Um... Hey, guys. Yeah. I'm wondering if maybe we shouldn't be alone
for this.

Gloria : Mm.
Phil : It's showtime !
Mitzi : Hey, Dunphy. You gettin' ready for your one-woman show?
Phil : Mitzi.

Stan : Come on in.

Mitzi : I'm in. Go back to condos, Dunphy. Oh, my God! This place is
absolutely gorgeous. Stunning. Stunning. You are in such good hands with
Phil.
Phil : Hey. How are you guys?
Mitzi : I mean, fingers crossed, though. You know, so many new companies go
belly-up. Terrible.
Modern Family Season 3x18 page.2

Phil : Well, good to... good to see you, Mitzi. Guys, how are you?

Bubbles : I heard you were in jail.

Patti : Oh, no. No, no, it's fine. It's fine. Come and take a look.
Mitzi : Oh, thank you. Thank you.

Lewis : Yeah? I heard you're still doing that lame giant scissors bit, you bluehaired hack. Who's in?

Phil : Mitzi, please! Mitzi, please! Please! What are you doing?

Chuckleberry : I'll go. Just give me a minute. I gotta redo my lips.

Mitzi : Oh, my God! He shoved me!

Lewis : All right. Cerveza. What about you, fizzy? You gonna come or you
gonna break up this party, too? Hey, shotgun, bitches!

Phil : What?!
Mitzi : He shoved me!
Stan : For God sakes! Phil! Oh, my God!
Mitzi : I thought you had your anger problem under control! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Phil : I don't have an anger... I don't... anger problem. I don't have an anger
problem.
Lewis : Whoa. Hey. It's over? What the hell?
Chuckleberry : You're an hour late.
Lewis : Huh. Good to see you, too, Chuckleberry. Look at that. Your oversized
pants are starting to fit.
Cameron : Hello, Lewis.
Lewis : Hello, Fizbo.
Cameron : For several years, I was one half of the renowned clown duo Fizbo
& Lewis. We were huge.
Mitchell : In children's parties.
Cameron : Anyway, I disbanded the group shortly after I met Mitchell. It's
hard to have a relationship and a clown career. That's the reason there are so
many single clowns.

Cameron : I should, you know, probably go. You know, for... for Al.
Mitchell : Oh, yeah, no, of course. But, hey, listen, don't let him get to you, all
right?
Cameron : No. It's fine. It's all seltzer under the bridge. Just one drink, and
then I'll be home.
Mitchell : Okay. Just drive me home first?
Cameron : No, you, uh, you... you take the car. I, uh, I'll go with the guys.
Mitchell : In that tiny car? How are you all possibly gonna... Forget I asked!
Mitchell : It's 5:00 in the morning.
Lily : Daddy's juggling!
Mitchell : Lily, honey, what are you doing up? Are you just getting home?
Cameron : Yeah, things got a little out of hand. Somebody had a flower that
squirted Tequila.
Lewis : What do you mean "somebody"? I want full credit. What up, red?
Mitchell : Really?
Lily : Teach me to juggle!
Lewis : It's very simple. The key is to be aware of where everything is at all
times. Oh!

Mitchell : Just one of the reasons.

Cameron : And don't forget the importance of balance! Oh!

Cameron : Anyway, um, Lewis hasn't spoken to me since. He's still bitter, and I
don't blame him. It's kind of like I broke up The Beatles.

Lewis : Whoa!

Mitchell : Of children's parties.

Cameron : I think I cracked my eggs.

Lewis : What do you say we hit a bar? Tip a few back to Al, huh?

Lewis : We're out of eggs? Are you yolking? And I haven't eaten in five days!
Five days! Are you cereal? Whoa!

Mitchell : Okay. Okay. Come on.

Modern Family Season 3x18 page.3

Mitchell : Lily, don't ever do that.

Jay : You know, I, uh, I saw a little of that basketball game of yours last week.
You were lightin' it up.

Claire : Okay. You two are deliberately not confirming me. Everybody else has
accepted my Facebook requests... Your father, Uncle Mitchell... Adele. That's
right. Adele has agreed to be my friend, and my own daughters haven't.

Griffin : Thanks.

Alex : Yeah, you may just be a fan of Adele, and...

Manny : Who's hot? We're hot! Mustangs are hot! Hey!

Manny : I was lighting it up, too, Jay.

Claire : What is so private that I can't possibly see it?
Haley : Nothing.

Gloria : Hola, Griffin. How are you?

Claire : Nothing. You just don't want to be my friend. Great. I can see my next
status update... "My daughters are monsters."

Griffin : Oh. 13. I'm fine.

Phil : You're not gonna believe this. Mitzi got the listing.

Gloria : So what do you boys have planned for today?

Claire : Oh, no, honey. That's awful.

Manny : Well, it's kind of a surprise for Griffin, but let's just say it involves
decoupage.

Phil : She cheated, she lied, and she won. Kids, gather 'round.

Jay : Oh, jeez.

Haley : Again, we are gathered.

Manny : Come on. Let's go.

Phil : You wanna get ahead? Don't play by the rules. Turns out nice guys finish
last in this cold, dog-eat-dog world.

Griffin : Good-bye.

Luke : It's not fair. Why don't you play dirty, too? You could take her down.
Claire : Honey, 'cause your dad is a better man than that. He has values and
morals and...
Phil : Shh. You. Keep talking. Well, just off the top of my head, you could take
my spy pen and record her admitting what she did. And then you could play
it for those people so they realize what a jerk she is.

Gloria : Oh, no.
Jay : What?
Gloria : You were right. This boy is not here to see Manny.
Jay : I told you. You see the way he looks at me?
Gloria : No, fonzie, the way he looks at me. He couldn't talk. He kept staring.
He was just like my teachers back in school.

Claire : Your dad is never gonna do that...

Jay : Gloria, you're very pretty. But the kid idolizes me.

Phil : You're a regular chatterbox today! Get me that pen!

Gloria : Really? Griffin! Manny! Do you want to go with Jay to ride his
motorcycle, or you want to go with me to the supermarket and buy a couple of
onions?

Manny : I got it!
Jay : Remember, pal, keep it simple.
Griffin : Hey, Manny.
Manny : Griffin... legendary creature of Greek mythology with the head of a
lion and wings of an eagle. What'd you say, Jay?
Jay : Never mind. Jay Pritchett. Nice to meet you.

Manny : Motorcycle rides!
Griffin : Onions sound good.
Jay : Huh. Guess he has a thing for you, too.
Cameron : Hey! We're back!

Griffin : Nice to meet you, too.
Modern Family Season 3x18 page.4

Mitchell : Hey, I-I just finished cleaning the kitchen, so if anyone has to do a
spit take, please do it over the sink.
Lewis : We felt really bad about that, so we got you a present.

Mitchell : Okay. Okay. Cards on the table. It's not my favorite thing that you...
Cameron : Oh, how dare you? I am a clown. It's who I am! If you squeeze me,
do I not honk? Eye roll!

Mitchell : What... what's the deal with this? I open it up and snakes fly out, or
a fire?

Mitchell : Oh, like I had a choice!

Lewis : No, we just know that you like to read.

Phil : Knock, knock.

Cameron : Yeah.

Mitzi : What are you doing here?

Lewis : So open it. Aah! Got him!
Mitchell : No. No. That's exactly what I expected. 'Member, when I told you?

Phil : Hey, um, I-I brought you some... soup. You know, I thought about it, and
maybe I did push you. So... how's the ankle?

Lewis : Okay. Look, it's almost go time, so we should have a shot and go white
up.

Mitzi : Oh, come on, Dunphy. You know I flopped. Haven't you ever seen an
nba game? Oh, I'm sorry. In your case, WNBA.

Mitchell : I'm sor... excuse me. "White up"?

Phil : So that was all a ruse?

Cameron : Oh, yeah. Lewis got a call to do a birthday party this afternoon, so
we're gonna put the old act back together.

Mitzi : The oldest trick in the book. You need to step up your game, son. You
know what? I almost feel sorry for you. Come here. Give me a big hug. Oh,
yeah. Yeah. No hard feelings, huh?

Lewis : Yeah, Fizbo & Lewis, together again. And they said it would never
happen.

Phil : None at all.

Mitchell : Said. Hoped. Could I talk to you for a second?

Mitzi : Good.

Lewis : Uh-oh. Trouble in queer-a-dise. Okay, look, gonna go out to the car for
smokes.

Phil : Because I just recorded your entire confession... Right here on my...

Mitchell : Please tell me "smokes" is not another clown, 'cause I don't think I
could handle another one of him.

Phil : Um...

Cameron : Oh, Lewis is not that bad.

Mitzi : Spy pen? Second-oldest trick in the book.
Mitzi : Oh, God. A real man would have just poisoned the soup. Are we...
done here?

Mitchell : Well, what do you see in that guy, Cam?
Cameron : I don't know. Maybe the fact that he doesn't roll his eyes every time
I talk about the art of clowning... Like that. He may have had his faults, but we
were great together. We had an unspoken language. We finished each other's
balloon animals. But you would never know, because you have never been to
one of our performances.

Jay : Ah. Thank you.

Mitchell : Birthday parties.

Manny : Yeah, and he said bring your swimsuits. He was pretty adamant
about it.

Cameron : You hate my clown side.
Mitchell : No. No. No. I don't hate it.
Cameron : Just admit it. I basically already know you do.

Manny : Hey, mom. Guess what? Griffin invited us all over to his house for a
pool party and barbecue tonight.
Jay : Pool party, huh?

Jay : It's 50 degrees outside.
Gloria : Sounds fun.
Manny : Great. I'll call him.
Modern Family Season 3x18 page.5

Jay : You know, you're basically agreeing to a date with a 13-year-old boy.

Luke : Hey. You're Mitzi Roth. I recognize you from your ads.

Gloria : Jay, we use this go get us tables at restaurants, why can't we use this to
get Manny a friend?

Mitzi : Smokin', right?

Jay : Because he's not really getting a friend.

Mitzi : I'm sorry.

Gloria : Oh, but when you thought that he was trying to ride your motorcycle,
it was okay.

Luke : Why do you hate him so much?

Jay : Maybe now I don't like what he's trying to ride.

Luke : I'm Luke Dunphy. My dad's Phil Dunphy.

Mitzi : It's just business, kid. It's not personal.

Gloria : No, no, no, papi. He loves you.

Luke : Well, it's personal to us. I've never seen my dad so worried before. I
have this spy pen, and I heard him talking to my mom, and he's scared about
paying for my sister's college next year. And I guess he's nervous about some
kind of party, because he said there's a big balloon payment. Anyways, he's
like the best dad ever, so maybe you could be a little nicer to him.

Manny : But you just said someday Griffin will like me. That means he doesn't
like me now.

Phil : There you are, buddy. Check it out. They're giving away free jelly beans.
Hey, Mitzi.

Jay : You know what, kid? We think that Griffin might be hanging out with
you because he's got a little crush on your mother and me.

Mitzi : Dunphy. You have a very nice kid there.

Gloria : Manny likes Griffin. Maybe someday, if they spend enough time
together, Griffin will like Manny.
Manny : What? Griffin doesn't like me?

Phil : He's mine.

Gloria : On you?
Manny : Wow. I can't believe it.
Jay : Listen, it's fine. You're gonna be fine. Okay?
Gloria : I'm sorry.
Manny : Are you kidding? It's fantastic!
Jay : How is it fantastic?
Manny : I'm only hanging out with him because I have the hots for his sister
Chloe. You've met Griffin. The kid's a doorknob.
Gloria : So you're just using him?
Manny : Yeah, and I felt really guilty about it until now. Now it's a win-win.
Gloria : Not for me!
Manny : Just suck it up, mom. I've done a lot for you over the years. Jay, you,
too. This girl could be the one. Then I'm out of your hair forever. Pool party,
mom. Dress accordingly.

Cameron : Hey, so I was thinking after, uh, little Fizbo, we could do the ladder
bit.
Lewis : Ah, crap. I forgot the ladder. You know what? I'll remember it next
weekend.
Cameron : What's next weekend?
Lewis : We got a town fair in thousand oaks and a birthday party in Pasadena.
Cameron : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I-I can't do that.
Lewis : W-what do you mean? I'm the one with outstanding warrants in
Pasadena.
Cameron : We're taking Lily to the aquarium next weekend. You know, Lewis,
this was just a onetime thing, right?
Lewis : What happened to "we're putting the act back together"?
Cameron : Well, that was just for today.
Lewis : Oh. Oh, sure.

Luke : Can you help me reach that box of cereal?

Cameron : I'm... I'm sorry if you thought...

Mitzi : Ugh.
Modern Family Season 3x18 page.6

Lewis : No, no, no. I get it. You're a family man now. Hey... Let's go out there
and make this the best show Fizbo & Lewis have ever done.

Phil : I'm so sorry. But thank you.

Cameron : You got it, partner.

Phil : Kids, gather 'round!

Lewis : Ladies and germs, boys and girls, say hello to my good friend... Little
Fizbo!

Haley : We are right here!

Cameron : Hello, big people!
Kids : Hi!
Cameron : Let's get this party started! Wow, all this dancing sure has made me
hungry! Wish I had something to eat! Heh! Oh! Oh, forgot I had that fish over
there. Don't know why he's so mad at me! He was fine just a minute ago. Ohh!
Okay! Somebody's a little punchy today! Oh. Hey. What's the frying pan doing
here? When did we add a frying pan to the act? We don't need... Nope! Don't
need the frying pan! Ow! Oh, gosh! Why are you doing that? Stop doing that.
Lewis : Screw you, you traitor.
Cameron : Ow! That hurts! Seriously, stop it!
Lewis : Know what hurts? Abandonment. Listen to 'em laughing. We could
have been something. We could have been some... I can't do this bit by myself!
Cameron : Somebody! Somebody! This isn't pretend! Someone grab an adult,
please!

Mitzi : Bye!

Phil : Oh. Let me tell you something... people are fundamentally good. The
key is, you find that goodness deep within 'em. Twist it, and turn it to your
advantage. Hello. Psh!
Phil : And... there she is. What are you gonna hit?
Luke : College, balloon payment, greatest dad ever.
Phil : Nice. Do you want me to squirt some tears in your eyes?
Luke : Dad, please. I was fake crying before I could walk. How do you think I
got out of eating all those salads? Can you help me reach that box of cereal?
Oh, hey. You're Mitzi Roth, right? I recognize you from your ads.
Mitzi : Smokin', huh?
Claire : I can't believe you got that listing back!
Phil : Sweetheart!
Claire : Honey! Oh.

Phil : Mitzi.

Phil : Honey?

Mitzi : Your kid forgot his cereal. There's a surprise in every box. Spoiler
alert... it's diabetes.

Claire : Mm-hmm?

Phil : You drove all the way over here for this?

Claire : You sure you wanna ding a chatterbox? Mnh-mnh.

Mitzi : Okay, look, here's the deal. You can have that listing if you want it.

Phil : Honey... Buddy, quick... What's the trick to those fake tears?

Phil : What?

Luke : The three stooges are all dead.

Mitzi : Yeah, the couple are a real pain. I'm too old for that kind of headache.
Just keep your mouth shut about it.

Phil : Yeah, that's good.

Phil : Thank you so much.

Claire : Well, it looks like somebody likes Coldplay.

Mitzi : I just said "zip it"!
Phil : Oh. You did.
Mitzi : Unbelievable.

Phil : Ding?

Alex : Mm. Right. You saw.
Claire : Uh-huh. Did you see the pictures I posted from Thanksgiving? Totes
adorbs.
Modern Family Season 3x18 page.7

Haley : I'm going to kill myself.
Claire : Hmm. You gotta check out my wall. Right there.
Haley : "Spring break, 1990, New Orleans." Is that you?
Claire : What?
Haley : Some guy from your college tagged you in a picture.
Claire : What is "tagging"? What is "tagging"?
Alex : Why are you drinking out of a funnel?
Haley : And why is his hand on your...
Claire : Untag it!
Haley : Oh, my goodness!
Claire : Un... untag it! Girls, I'm serious! Untag it! Tear down the wall!

3x19 : Election Day

Claire : I love it.
Mitchell : We got it on Craigslist. Came off a taco truck.

Phil : Councilwoman Dunphy, how do you respond to allegations that you
look super sexy in your new suit?

Cameron : It did.

Claire : Uh, I haven't been elected yet. Come on, kids! We gotta vote! Honey,
come on. Please stop filming.

Cameron : You're welcome.

Phil : I'm just excited! After today, you are going to be a councilwoman, and I
am going to be a first husband.

Mitchell ! I know how important winning is to Claire.

Claire : And if you don't stop filming, you're going to be my first husband. All
right, everybody, come on! Do you know what you're doing, kids? You guys
are manning the phone banks. Alex, you're in charge of that.

Mitchell : We're her dream team.

Claire : I love that you're doing this for me. Thank you!

Cameron : And I love to festoon things.

Haley : Wh-why is she in charge? And what's... what's a phone bank?

Cameron : So we cleared the whole day, dropped Lily off at school, and voted
first thing.

Alex : That's why.

Mitchell : Although, uh, one of us had a bit of a dimpled chad situation.

Claire : Phil.
Phil : I got it. I will be driving 50 of our finest senior citizens to the polls,
assuming, of course, that they remember that I'm coming for them. Where you
at?

Cameron : Can you tell me how this machine works again, Chad?
Chad : Oh, sure. No problem.
Cameron : Just wanna look in here. Just...

Luke : High-five. Old people occasionally forget things.
Claire : Okay. All right, everybody, let's go. Let's go.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Phil : Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Real quick! Sorry. Everybody get in there.
Jump in there. I just want to say how proud of you we all are. You're an
inspiration. Who would have thought that 20 years ago when you were still in
the bloom of your youth...

Claire : Thank you. Thank you.
Phil : Bye! Bye!

Claire : Okay, I'm gonna go start the car.

Claire : Thank you, guys!

Jay : Claire likes to win. When she was 8, a little girl scout friend of hers
bragged she could sell the most cookies. Damn if Claire didn't walk the
neighborhood till she got blisters on her feet and won by ten boxes. Best part is
Claire wasn't even a girl scout.

Claire : Bye! Thank you! Oh, my gosh. Okay, everybody, get in the car. Let's
go. Let's go.

Cameron : I can see Clairely now that Duane is gone.

Laurie : Good luck today, Claire.
Claire : Oh, Laurie, thank you.
Laurie : Hey, by the way, we have some really good news.

Cameron : The choice is Claire! Vote Claire Dunphy for town council.

claire : What's that?

Claire : Aw, I love it!

Laurie : Becky got into the University of Oregon.

Mitchell : What do you think, huh?

Claire : Oh, congratulations!
Modern Family Season 3x19 page.1

Laurie : Any news, Haley?
Haley ; Uh, uh, no, not... not yet, but, you know, super psyched!
Haley : This whole waiting-to-hear thing has been a nightmare since the very
first letter.
Haley : I'm too nervous. I can't do it.
Alex : "Dear miss Dunphy, we regret to inform you..."
Haley : What?! Don't leave me hanging!
Haley : After that, I decided to only tell my parents good news. I have one
school left, and the only good news I've gotten is that my annoying neighbor
Becky is moving back east to Oregon.
Jay : Manny, write this down.
Manny : I didn't bring a pen.
Jay : Election day is America at its finest. The people speak, and the
government listens. I don't know what they do in Colombia.
Gloria : No one does, and don't ask.
Jay : I mean, we know that voting's a privilege, but for my daughter to have
her name on that ballot, it just means so much more... You know what? I think
I'm gonna vote later.

Cameron : Oh, my God. Look at that. There's a trash can right there, and that
guy just threw his paper on the sidewalk. Hey! You in the yellow jacket. Pick it
up and put it in the trash.
Mitchell : Oh, my God. He did it.
Cameron : Yes, he did.
Mitchell : Ooh, here. Let me try one. I'll try... Hey, dragon tattoo, no
jaywalking!
Cameron : oh, my gosh. This is an instrument of power. How could they not
sell tacos?
Mitchell : You know what we could do with this thing? Cam, we could really
make a difference. We could be the voice of change.
Cameron : Ooh, I got it! Let's go yell at the dry cleaner that lost my shirt.
Phil : Come on, gang. Today is the Dunphys at their best.
Reporter : Hi. I'm from the "Weekly Saver." Mind if I ask you a couple
questions about the big election?
Claire : Not at all. Fire away.
Reporter : Who are you voting for today?
Claire : Claire Dunphy.
Reporter : Finally. I've been waiting for someone to say that name. Why?
Claire : Uh... Because I am Claire Dunphy.

Gloria : What? Where are you going?

Reporter : Oh, sorry. They moved me over from ad sales. We take turns
reporting. How do you feel about your chances today?

Jay : Ah, the line is too long.

Claire : Not as good as I did a few minutes ago.

Gloria : It's only three people! And nobody has a gun!

Phil : No, she feels great. Um, her spirits are high. The whole family's high.
There's your headline.

Cameron : We're here, we're Claire, get used to it!
Mitchell : You know, I'm not sure if that's tracking. Here, let me try one. You
don't have to be Clairevoyant to know who to vote for. Vote Dunphy for town
council. Uh, uh, uh, Claire Dunphy. Uh, C-Claire's her first name. I'm sorry if
that wasn't Claire.

Claire : Phil, no.
Reporter : Uh, how about a photo of all of you?
Claire : Yeah. Sure. Yes.
Alex : Mom, mom, mom. Tag. Tag's still on.
Claire : Oh, my Goodness. Thank you. That would have been a really
awkward picture. Okay. No!
Modern Family Season 3x19 page.2

Alex : What is that? Is that a tooth?

Gloria : Manny, give us a minute.

Haley : Ew!

Manny : Oh, sure. I served him up on a silver platter.

Luke : Awesome!
Haley : How old are you?

Jay : What? All right, it's no big deal. There was a woman working there. I
didn't want her to see me.

Claire : No!

Gloria : Who is she?

Luke : Do it again!

Jay : Her name is Dottie. She's the first woman I dated after my divorce.

Alex : How does that even happen?

Gloria : You dated a Dottie after Dede?

Claire : It's a-a fake tooth from an old ice-skating injury. It just fell out. Oh, my
gosh. Why today?! What about the...

Jay : Y-you're focusing on the wrong thing here. The... the point is it ended
badly. I tried to let her down easy, but, uh, she didn't take it too well.

Phil : Let's not overreact. Let's... let me see it.

Gloria : What happened back there?

Jay : Actually, I don't know how she took it, 'cause I wasn't there. We dated a
few weeks, then after we... You know, I slipped out of her house before she
woke up and never called her again. Put my pants on in her yard, put the car
in neutral, let it roll down the driveway, lights off. Hey, I can't talk about this
anymore.

Jay : Line was too long. I couldn't wait. I've seen you wait 45 minutes in line
for sherbet! Well, I happen to like sherbet, okay? That place I take you has the
greatest sherbet on the west coast. They got lime sherbet, they got coconut
sherbet.

Gloria : So because of this woman, you didn't vote for your daughter? It's
Claire! We need her to win! I don't want to be around when something that
tight comes unraveled.

Gloria : Why are we talking about sherbet?

Jay : I'll figure out something. Maybe those poll workers take shifts.

Manny : He's clearly changing the subject.
Jay : Why aren't you in school?

Gloria : Stop hiding in your little cave like a... Like, you know. Like the... the...
the...

Manny : He's doing it again.

Jay : I really don't wanna do this again.

Gloria : Manny's right. You're being very ardilla.

Gloria : No, the... No. No. The big one, like, uh, the monster furry one. Ay,
why can't I remember any animal names?

Claire : Okay. All right.
Reporter : Got it. Thanks.

Jay : "Ardilla"?
Gloria : Yeah, you know, the... The one that... that...
Jay : Rabbit? I was being rabbit-y?

Phil : Climb aboard the Dunphy Express. Next stop... democracy.

Gloria : No, another one with the cheeks and the tail and...

Walt : Well... no, no...

Jay : Chipmunk? Possum?

Phil : Please don't go. I won't do that anymore. I promise.

Manny : Okay, obviously she means squirrel. You were being squirrely then,
you're being squirrely now.

Walt : Oh. Uh, we need to make a quick stop. I gotta pick up my new glasses.
Phil : No can do. I, uh... I got a lot of people waitin', so...

Jay : Better than being a rat.
Modern Family Season 3x19 page.3

Walt : It'll just take two minutes. I can't even see the ballot without my glasses.
I mark the wrong box, next thing you know I'll be married to a guy.

Mitchell : Is it?

Phil : Yeah, I... I don't think it's mandatory, Walt.

Mitchell : Oh, my god.

Walt : I'm a good dancer. They'll come for me. Oh, yeah.

Cameron : Mitchell, you're sitting on the button.

Cameron : They will break all your buttons... and say you brought it in that
way. Okay, go, go, go!
Mitchell : Turns out we had a lot of axes to grind.

Cameron : She's looking over here.

Mitchell : What? No... no, I'm not. No, I'm not! The... it's stuck! And you're the
one that had it last when you were talking to the cheese shop!
Cameron : Because you know what? If you advertise truffle cheese, there are
certain expectations...
Mitchell : Hi, Sandy.

Cameron : And a hybrid, so there was virtually no stopping us.
Gloria : Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Claire Dunphy.
Mitchell : Do not see that movie! You will neither laugh nor cry!

Manny : What a beautiful name.

Cameron : "Best pizza in the city"? Not even the best pizza on this street.

Alex : She used to be a citizen.

Mitchell : They do not do the hair of the people on those pictures!

Manny : I'm calling on behalf of Claire Dunphy for town council.

Cameron : "Totally free checking"? Don't bank on it!

Luke : All right. How about this? If you vote for Claire Dunphy... You won't
have to pay taxes for the rest of your life.

Mitchell : Okay, that was really fun, but now we gotta go back to campaigning
for Claire.

Alex : Vote for Claire! Luke! What are you doing? You can't say that!

Cameron : We've been saying that for two hours.

Luke : Oh, like she'd be the first politician to make a promise she can't keep.

Mitchell : Yes, but now I-I really mean it. Oh, my god, there's Sandy!

Gloria : Well, maybe I don't want to talk to you, either. Maybe you are the one
that is bothering me! How do you like that? Eh?

Cameron : Sandra Bullock?
Mitchell : Yeah, Sandra Bullock. We're such good friends, I call her "Sandy,"
So... No, Sandy who works at Lily's preschool. Right there.

Alex : Gloria, I'm gonna have to ask you again to please stick to your script.

Cameron : Oh, yeah. You know, she got engaged.

Gloria : But everybody's saying no to me! I don't get it. Usually when I ask
someone to do something, they just do it!

Mitchell : No! To the gay boyfriend?

Alex : Maybe it's because these people can't see you.

Cameron : Totally.

Gloria : I don't like it. Can't you just hook me up to some sort of camera?

Mitchell : Oh, how does she not see it?

Manny : Well, thank you, Maggie, for the vote. Okay. Bye-bye.

Cameron : If I was with somebody that gorgeous, I'd overlook a few quirks,
too.

Tech guy : Here's your seat.

Mitchell : First of all, thank you. Second of all... point well taken. I don't know.
Poor Sandy. I feel so bad for her.

Claire : Thank you. Um, you'll have to excuse me. I'm a little nervous. I've
never been on the radio before.

Cameron : Well, it's better than being alone.

Cecil : Don't worry about it. Just think of it as a conversation.
Modern Family Season 3x19 page.4

Claire : Okay.

Walt : Is oxygen serious?

Tech guy : Here are your headphones. Volume control. Don't get too far from
the mike.

Phil : You know what? I lost a ton of time getting your glasses. I'm just gonna
drop you at home. You can get your air. I can drive other people.

Claire : Okay.

Walt : I don't have any more tanks at home.

Tech guy : Make sure your cell phone's off.

Phil : Why? That seems like bad planning.

Claire : Oh. Cell phone. Right. Um...

Walt : Well, I forgot to order them. My pills make me forget things. Oh, shoot! I
gotta take my pill!

Tech guy : And you're not chewing gum, are you?
Claire : No, I'm not. I just had some temporary dental work done. The last
thing I need...

Phil : Please tell me you have it with you.

Cecil : And welcome back to "A matter of record." I'm Cecil Van Gundy.
Joining us now in studio is district 43 town council candidate Claire Dunphy.

Phil : Are you asking me?

Claire : Thank you, Cecil. It's a pleasure to be here.

Phil : Okay, I'll get you whatever you want! I'll get you the air, I'll get you the
food.

Cecil : So... You're a first-time candidate. Tell us what got you involved.
Claire : It all started with a, um... With a stop sign. I was concerned about
safety in our neighbourhood and I was not getting any satisfaction from city
hall.
Luke : What's wrong with mom?
Alex : Oh, this isn't good.
Gloria : She sounds drunk!
Haley : That's not her drunk voice.
Cecil : Tell us about some of the other issues facing our town. Where do you
stand on the city's sewage and sustainability initiative, the so-called S.S.I.?
Claire : One cannot really talk about s-s-sewage and sustainability without
first discussing... recycling. This city can do more...

Walt : Of course I do, but I have to take 'em with food. Don't I?
Walt : Uh, yes! I do take them with food! Ooh. I don't feel so well.

Walt : Then I'll vote for your drunk wife.
Phil : That is not her drunk voice!
Dottie : Thank you so much for voting. We appreciate it.
Jay : Hi. I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me. Jay Pritchett. Uh, can I get in... in and
out really quick? Thank you. This is all I needed. Thank you very much. Thank
you very much. All right. Claire, Claire, Claire. Claire, Claire... ahh, ahh. Here.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Hello, Dottie!
Dottie : Jay! It's so nice to see you!
Jay : Is it?

Walt : What the hell's wrong with her?

Dottie : Oh, why wouldn't it be? That was a long time ago. Water under the
bridge. We're good.

Claire : With the recycling program...

Jay : Oh, that's great.

Walt : She sounds drunk!

Dottie : Thank you so much for voting.

Claire : ...currently...
Phil : It's a tooth thing. What's wrong?

Jay : You remember my daughter Claire. She's... She's running for town
council.

Walt : Oh, I'm almost out of air. Oh, boy.

Dottie : Oh, isn't that neat?

Phil : Is that serious?

Jay : Yeah, I'm so proud. So you're gonna put it in there, huh?
Dottie : Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. Definitely.
Modern Family Season 3x19 page.5

Jay : Cause every vote counts, you know.

Sandy : He gossips!

Dottie : Thank you so much for voting.
Jay : You know...

Mitchell : No. No. You're missing the point, okay? We see a great-looking guy
like Gregory, and we say he's gay because we want him to be gay!

Dottie : Yeah.

Sandy : Really? Really? Are you sure?

Jay : Boy, I'd sure like to see the sweet sight of my vote... counting.

Mitchell : Yes.

Dottie : Why would I say I'd do something and not do it? That would make
me a liar... instead of a trusting widow who fell asleep in the warm embrace of
a man who promised to make breakfast.

Cameron : Yes. Absolutely. Look at what we do with movie stars.
Mitchell : Okay.

Jay : Okay, here it is. Look, I am so sorry. You were the first woman I'd been
with besides my ex... 35 years. I panicked. An-and it wasn't 'cause y-you
weren't pretty naked or anything like that. I'd have run from Angie Dickinson.

Cameron : You know? Hugh Jackman... he sings, he dances, he's dreamy! So
obviously we would want him on our team! But he's straight. Trust me, I
know. I said hello to him once in a restaurant, and there was absolutely no
chemistry.

Dottie : Oh, lucky her.

Mitchell : Well, if that isn't proof...

Jay : Dottie...
Dottie : Good-bye, Jay!
Jay : Dottie, Dottie, please. I'm just trying to get my ballot in the box.
Dottie : oh, yeah, that sounds familiar.
Jay : Yeah, but you don't have to do anything. Just let me put it in! Uhh.
Shouldn't have said that.

Cameron : Three weeks later, Sandy and Gregory got married, and everyone
said the wedding was beautiful.
Mitchell : Gregory did the flowers.... Which is perfectly normal for a straight
guy.
Walt : The Greeks do one thing right, and it's lamb!

Cameron : We are so sorry. We did not mean for you to hear any of that.

Phil : All right. Let's go vote.

Mitchell : Yes, and you know what? We shouldn't have been gossiping in the
first place.

Walt : Why the hell does your wife want to be a politician, anyway?

Sandy : But what if you're right? What if Gregory is gay? When my mom said
it, I didn't believe her. She lives in Iowa. But coming from you two!

Phil : You heard her. She wanted to put up a stop sign at Bristol and Greenleaf,
But then she ran into...
Walt : Wait, wait, wait! That's near where I live!

Cameron : Means nothing.

Phil : Yeah. We're neighbors. Let's go!

Mitchell : No.
Cameron : We barely know your fiance. If he says he's straight, he's straight.

Walt : No way I'm voting for that! Too much government already. I didn't fight
a war so some politician could tell me where I have to stop my car.

Mitchell : Mm. Straight.

Phil : You don't even drive!

Sandy : We're getting married in a month. People are flying in. He signed us
up for dance classes.

Walt : That's 'cause that Barack Obama took my license away.

Mitchell : Oh, my god! No. No, no, no. Hey. This is what gays do. We gossip.

Phil : I don't think he was involved in the decision! I left the house today to get
50 votes for my wife. I'm not going home with zero. The least you can do is

Cameron : We gossip a lot.
Modern Family Season 3x19 page.6

walk right in there and punch a hole for the woman who drags your garbage
can up your driveway every Tuesday!

Phil : One.

Walt : I don't like it! Goes against everything I believe in.
Phil : Really? A stop sign?!
Walt : But I'll do it, 'cause you're a good kid. And I had a nice day... till you
started yelling at me.

Claire : And my beautiful children, whose faith has given me the confidence to
believe that I can do this. I can... oh. Somebody else answer it. I lost.
Alex : Mom. Mom.

Phil : So sorry. Thank you. Here you go.

Claire : I can feel it. I...

Walt : You know, my wife was an alcoholic, too.

Alex : Mom. You can do it. Mom. Answer the phone.

Phil : Okay. Let's just go vote.

Claire : Hello? This is she. Thanks so much for calling. Bye-bye. I have some
bad news.

Claire : Hi, everyone!

Phil : Because someone's gonna be busy now that she's a councilwoman?

Alex : Any news?

Claire : No, no, I wasn't doing that fake thing. I really lost. I lost.

Claire : Not yet, not yet, but even if I lose, at least now I know I have a future
in radio.

Gloria : Ay, no.

Gloria : I couldn't. People need to see me.

Claire : Yeah! I... I don't know about you, But, um... I could use a glass of wine.

Claire : Before we get the results, I just want to thank you all for everything
you've done for me. Mitch and Cam, for campaigning for me all day in your
little Claire-mobile.

Luke : Ohh. Now you're gonna hear her drunk voice.

Cameron : It's the least we could do.
Cameron : Literally
Mitchell : We probably did more for Hugh Jackman's career than we did for
Claire's.

Phil : I'm so sorry. But you know what? We are still just so proud of you.

Haley : Mom? You okay?
Claire : Yes. Fine. I'm good. I'm fine. I'm not fine. I wanted to win, And... and
I'm so embarrassed. I mean, everybody out here worked so hard for me, and
they believed in me, and I let 'em down. Oh, honey. Oh, sweetheart. Well,
don't cry. I'm gonna be fine, sweetie. Really, I am. Just knowing you care so
much makes me feel better.
Haley : No, I got four rejection letters I never told you guys about.
Claire : What?

Claire : And, Manny and Gloria, thank you for making all those phone calls.
And, dad... for all your support.

Haley : I got rejected from U.C.S.B., Oregon, Wisconsin...
Claire : Oh, no.
Haley : And Northwestern.

Gloria : I don't think I convinced anyone to vote for Claire.

Claire : Well, we were overshooting on that one. What about, uh...

Jay : I don't think I even voted.

Haley : It came today. My last chance. I'm too scared to open it.

Claire : And my husband... who drove around I don't know how many senior
citizens today to the polls.

Claire : Whatever it says in there, your father and I are crazy proud of you.
Okay?
Modern Family Season 3x19 page.7

Haley : I did start trying this year.
Claire : I know you did. You did. You have nothing to be ashamed of.

Claire : I did it. I made our neighborhood a little bit safer. I may have even
saved life. You idiot, there's stop sign! Can't you read? we need speed bumps.

Haley : Neither do you.

Phil : No, no. No! Honey!

Claire : It's a little bit different.
Haley : No, it's exactly the same. Except you tried really hard the whole time,
not just at the end.
Claire : You're right. It is the same. We have nothing to be ashamed of... so let's
open that together.
Phil : Yeah, open it.
Haley : What? No! What are you doing here?
Mitchell : No. Come on, Haley. We believe in you.
Alex : Do it!
Jay : You can always work for me.
Alex : Come on. You can do it. You can do this.
Claire : Come on, Haley.
Phil : All right.
Haley : "Dear Miss Dunphy, we regret to inform you..."
Phil : Oh, honey.
Haley : "While we cannot offer you admission at this time, you are a
promising candidate, and therefore we would like to place you on our wait
list!" Oh, my god, I got wait-listed!
Claire : We will take it!
Gloria : Congratulations! Congratulations!
Phil : Our daughter might be going to college!
Claire : Phil, look. A stop sign.
Phil : It's addressed to you.
Claire : "Dear Claire, I won. You lost. Here's your stupid stop sign. Next time
you think about bothering me, please take its advice. Your councilman, the
honorable Duane Bailey."
Phil : Honey, you did it!
Modern Family Season 3x19 page.8

3x20 : The Last Walt

Phil : I'm more worried about the one you showed. What's with all the
smiling?

Claire : We have to tell him.

Claire : What are you talking about?

Phil : I hope he's okay.

Phil : That grin. "Walt's dead." You looked like the joker.
Claire : I didn't smile.

Claire : Walt, our elderly next door neighbor, died. He and Luke were pretty
close, so we have to tell him. I'm a little nervous about it.

Phil : You did. It's like a weird coping mechanism. You did the same thing
when you told him his hamster died.

Phil : I think we should break it to him slowly.

Claire : I don't know what you thought you saw, Phil, but our child just got
some terrible news and had absolutely no reaction. Doesn't that concern you?

Claire : Like how?
Phil : Well, first we'd say, "Luke, your friend Walt has a cold. You shouldn't go
over there." Next day... "bad news. Walt's in the hospital," but he's still cracking
jokes with the nurses." Next day... "they're trying an experimental drug."
Fingers crossed." Next day... "his body rebelled. He's in a coma." Next day... he
rallies, next day... coma, next day... coma, next day... coma, next day... eye
flutter...

Phil : Yeah. He probably just needs time to process it.
Claire : Hmm. Do you think?
Phil : Yeah, honey. Death is a profound thing to deal with at any age. We all
manage it differently. Some people lock up their feelings. Others... reach out
for comfort, finding some way to reaffirm their connection to life...
Claire : You're joking.

Claire : Stop. Just stop. Stop. Oh.

Phil : Oh.

Claire : Oh, Luke, we have some bad news for you. It's about Walt. I'm afraid...
he passed away.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Phil : Um, it happened yesterday. He finished writing an angry letter to the
postmaster general, and he just fell asleep.

Gloria : Hola, Haley.

Luke : Okay.
Phil : It was very peaceful. Not the letter. That was full of threats, but...
Claire : It's okay to be sad, honey. You two were really good friends. It must be
quite a shock to hear that... Walt's dead.
Phil : Um, so do you wanna talk about it or...
Luke : I'm okay. Can I get back to my video game? It's paused.
Phil : Oh, um, sure. Yeah, buddy. Come here.
Claire : How weird was that?
Phil : I know. Crazy weird.
Claire : It's like he had no feelings at all.

Haley : Gloria, I was driving by and saw this outside your door, so here.
Gloria : Thank you.
Haley : No problem. Hey, so since I'm already here, my friend was gonna have
a pool party tonight, but he got sick. Could we have it here?
Gloria : Mm. Good thing that you saw this paper or if not, you would have
never been able to ask.
Haley : Yeah.
Gloria : I'm sorry, but Jay and I are going to Mitch and Cam's for dinner
tonight.
Haley : I'm just thinking out loud here. What if I get a chaperone that my
parents approve of? Would it be okay then?

Modern Family Season 3x20 page.1

Gloria : Well, I guess so. You know, it would be good for Manny to have a little
bit of fun. Do you mind if he stays here for the party?

Mitchell : Okay. Nice to see you. All right, let me grab that for you.

Haley : Mind? The plan depended on him.

Merle : No. No. I got it. I will take that beer you were about to offer me,
though.

Claire : I don't suppose you've thought of a chaperone?

Cameron : Oh, yeah. Coming right up. And you know where everything is. Go
have a seat.

Haley : Of course not, mom, because it's going to be a wild party and I'm
trying to get away with something, as usual. Yes, I thought of a chaperone...
my Uncle who already said he would do it. But if that's gonna be a problem, I
think I should just call everybody...
Claire : Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. It's fine.

Mitchell : Oh, I missed a call from my dad.
Cameron : Oh, let me guess. Is he calling to cancel? What's his excuse this
time?
Mitchell : You know, that's a really mean thing to assume, Cam. I really wish
you'd give my dad a break for once.

Haley : And thank you, Uncle Manny.

Cameron : Oh, please. You know Jay doesn't like my dad. He thinks he's some
bumpkin from the sticks. Well, I will have you know that Merle Stonewall
Tucker is one of the most respected farmers in all of Hell's Hollow, Missouri.

Cameron : Can you help a little bit?

Mitchell : Okay, you're not hearing yourself. My dad likes him just fine. Come
on.

Mitchell : This... if I... if I push down, does that...
Cameron : Yeah, that's helping. That's helping.
Mitchell : No, it's not helping. It's 'cause it's stuck.
Cameron : I can't believe I got 'em this stuck. I've built beds my whole life...
bunk beds, dog beds, cow beds.
Mitchell : Okay, I'm calling you on cow beds.
Cameron : Oh, that's my dad! Okay. He can help. He's built a boat, a dock, a
lake...
Mitchell : Uh, he did not build a lake. Okay, from now on, just stop after you
say the second thing.
Merle : So the cabin door swings open, damned if there wasn't a lady pilot in
there.
Cameron : Yeah, well, I hate to admit it, but it throws me, too. I do prefer a
man.
Merle : Are we gonna have this conversation again?
Mitchell : Hey, Merle. Hey. How are you?
Merle : Yeah, ooh.

Jay : Hello?
Mitchell : Hey, dad. It's me.
Jay : Mitch. I'm sick. I gotta cancel tonight.
Mitchell : Yeah. Yeah, 6:00. We're really looking forward to it.
Jay : What are you doing? I just said I can't come.
Mitchell : I don't know. Let me ask. My dad wants to know red or white?
Cameron : Um, uh, red.
Mitchell : Red. And I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah, Cam says red. Okay. Yeah, he's...
he's so happy... Knock it off, old man. You are not sick. Why do you always do
this?
Jay : Okay, look, between you and me, Mervis kind of bugs me.
Mitchell : Okay, first of all, it's Merle. Mervis isn't a name. Mervis is a sound.
And second of all, he's... he's my partner's father. Okay? You're coming.
Cameron : Okay, dad, why don't you settle in? We don't have plans until
dinner tonight with Jay and Gloria.
Merle : I-I don't like that guy.
Modern Family Season 3x20 page.2

Cameron : What? That's... you like everybody.
Merle : Not Jay. The guy rubs me the wrong way. Every time I try to do
something nice, he makes this cranky face, like...
Cameron : Okay. Well, you know what? I'm gonna chalk this up to jet lag for
you because it's not like you at all. Okay, you have to make an effort. It's my
partner's father. Now give me the growl that means "okay." Good.
Phil : Did you know Walt had a daughter he was completely estranged from?
His lawyer said she wouldn't even honor his last request to toss his dog tags in
the ocean. Can you imagine?
Claire : Phil, do we really have to go through this again? I told you, I would
do everything possible to make sure that your skeleton ends up in a science
class at a women's college.
Phil : No, it's just sad. That's half of what would keep me going in my old
age... remembering all the good times with the kids. Teaching Luke to ride his
bike, Haley at the father-daughter dance... Taking Alex for her first pony ride.

Alex : Adventure? We are throwing dog tag into an already polluted ocean
where they will probably choke an otter.
Phil : 80% my fault.
Phil : Honey, we're bringing closure to a man's life. We'll hike up to the scenic
overlook, where apparently, Walt proposed to his wife, wait for the light to be
just right, say a few words. Share some memories.
Alex : That's kind of poetic. Kind of navajo.
Phil : Now you're getting it. We'll be sending him off with a level of dignity,
that if we're lucky, someday we'll experience, too. It's called...
Claire : Hey. What do you got there? Walt's old TV?
Luke : He said I could take one thing after he died. I wish he would've said
two things. I would've taken that phone with the big buttons.

Claire : You never took Alex on a pony ride.

Claire : I bet you guys had some really good times watching this thing, right?

Phil : Oh, right. That was just me.

Luke : No. I just wanted a TV in my room.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Claire : You know, Luke, there might be a nicer way to honor Walt's memory.

Phil : But Alex and I went, um, oh, no. That was Haley.

Luke : What do you mean?

Claire : Phil, look. It's Luke. He's going into Walt's house.

Claire : Well, I mean, you guys liked to garden. We could, uh, we could take
one of his flowers and plant it in our yard, and then every spring, when...

Phil : Oh, he's saying good-bye. He just needed a little time.
Claire : It's so sweet and so sad. He's so much more sensitive than I ever
thought. They had a special bond. I wouldn't be surprised if one day he wrote
a book like "Tuesdays with Morrie."
Phil : I never read it. Did that guy steal Morrie's TV?

Luke : There we go.
Claire : Sweetie, how are you feeling? Sad? Angry? Confused? Frustrated? You
know you can talk to me.
Luke : I know, but I can't see through you. Could you scootch?
Claire : No. No. You know, this is not okay. It's going back.

Phil : Now setting a course for adventure! Beep. Boop. Beep. Bop. Boop. Boop.
Boop.
Phil : I've had great experiences with all my kids, but I... I might have fallen
behind a bit with Alex. My fault completely.

Luke : What? He said I could pick one thing.
Claire : This isn't picking. It's looting, and it's going back.
Luke : You are so mean. When Walt used to look through those binoculars and
say, "your dad's one lucky man," he was wrong.
Manny : Hi, Haley.
Modern Family Season 3x20 page.3

Haley : Hi. Stef, Sam, this is Manny.

Alex : Dad, I really gotta get home.

Sam : What's up, dude?
Haley : Kitchen's over there and pool's in the back.

Phil : I know. I know. You gotta do homework. But you can't expect me to see
a sign that says, "world's greatest milk shake... 50 miles," and not drive to it.

Manny : So where are your parents?

Francine : Sorry, sweetie. Machine's broken.

Haley : They're not coming.
Manny : I was told there'd be a chaperone.
Haley : There is. It's you. My parents are totally fine with it.
Manny : Well, exits, fire extinguisher, burn kit. Okay, let's have some fun.
Manny : I believe I was clear the bedrooms were off-limits. Young lady, I don't
think you're ready up here for what you're planning to do up there. Ugh. Not
on my watch.
Merle : Oh, this was a delicious meal, Mitchell. I wish my wife could cook a
roast like this. You got a good one there, son.

Phil : I just wanted a special day with my daughter, you know, like "the time
we gave an old man a dramatic sendoff at the beach," or... or "the time we
drove 100 miles" for the world's greatest milk shake."
Customer : Call us when it happens, Francine.
Francine : Oh, it could be before you get home. I'm a week past my due date
as it is. What can I do for you?
Phil : "The time we delivered a baby." We were the only ones there, and she
was so close, the sound of a pin dropping could induce labor.

Cameron : Oh, well, I'm very lucky, just like you and mama. Never had a bad
patch. Except the winter of '85. Remember that?

Phil : Okay! What looks good? What looks good? What looks good?

Merle : Oh, I spent several nights in the cow bed then.

Francine : Well, um...

Cameron : Oh, here. Let me help you.
Merle : No, no, no. You sit... sit down. Let... lets us guys catch up here a little
bit.
Jay : I'll tell you why I don't like that guy... and I could never say this to
Mitch... he treats my son like the wife in the relationship. Always has.
Merle : Before we get to dessert, I've got some presents here.
Cameron : Oh! Oh, you didn't need to, dad. Love it!
Mitchell : Oh, Merle, thank you so much. Look at this. Oh. So elegant, huh?
Oh, this is so sweet. I think I might cry.
Jay : Don't.

Lily : Bam!
Merle : Wh-whoa! Kids love to destroy things.
Gloria : Not Manny. He's always been a little bit too serious. I would make the
buildings, and he would inspect them. And if they weren't up to code, ay, ay,
ay, the paperwork.
Merle : I remember Cam, one time, rolled a tractor tire right through a chicken
coop. He was 3 at the time.
Jay : I remember Mitchell, one time, karate-chopped a plate glass window. Got
17 stitches.
Gloria : Ah, yes. I love that story. Which one of the Charlie's Angels he was
being again?
Jay : That's not important.

Modern Family Season 3x20 page.4

Merle : I think it was Farrah. Yeah, the thing I remember is, when Mitchell told
that story, how... how he giggled all the way through.

Cameron : My dad's got it.

Jay : I'm sure he wasn't giggling.

Merle : Yeah, that's good.

Merle : Oh, yeah, he... he was giggling, all right.

Jay : Oh. It's coming.

Jay : No, see, Mitchell has a booming laugh. It's Cameron, actually... has the
high laugh. You know...

Merle : We got it. We got it.

Merle : No, I think Mitch has a higher laugh than... it's...
Jay : No, it's...

Jay : All right, let's see here. Hang on, Merle. Wait. Here. Huh? Hold.

Cameron : Oh, there you go. There you go.
Merle : Cam, why don't you go get us a couple of cold ones? We'll finish this
job up in here.
Cameron : Sure thing, dad. You earned it.

Cameron : Listen to them.

Mitchell : Yeah. Good helping there, Merle.

Mitchell : Listen to them. Best of friends.
Cameron ; Oh, man. I'm sorry I doubted Jay. He's been lovely.

Claire : Okay. Wow. It's hot in here. It's, like, 80 degrees.

Mitchell : Oh, well, confession time... he kinda didn't want to come.

Luke : He did that so the Meals on Wheels lady had to take off her sweater.

Cameron : Well, you're gonna laugh because my dad was kinda hoping he
wouldn't.

Claire : How do we turn on the lights in here? Of course. So, Luke, now that
we're here, you wanna take a minute and say what Walt meant to you?

Mitchell : Wha? Oh. They just needed to get to know one another better. I am
so glad that we did this.

Luke : Nope.

Cameron : Yeah, me, too.

Claire : Luke, you are going through something huge in your life, and I'm
concerned that you're not processing it in a normal, healthy way.

Mitchell : Oh, that's so funny. Wh-what did your dad not like about my dad?

Luke : I'm sad. I'm so very sad.

Cameron : Oh, well, you know Jay. He's a Teddy bear, but sometimes he can
kinda come off as a tough guy.

Claire : No, I don't just wanna hear what you think I wanna hear. I want you
to really tell me...

Mitchell : Yeah, that's true.

Kim : Hi. It's Kim with Meals on Wheels.

Cameron : As an actual tough guy, you can kinda see how that would rub my
dad the wrong way.

Claire : Oh.

Mitchell : Oh, it's... I-I could see that, but, you know, my dad's actually pretty
tough himself, so...
Cameron : Oh, yeah, city tough, you know, not farm tough.
Mitchell : Uh-huh. You mean cities, where there are gangs, as to opposed to
farms, where there are ducks?
Merle : Oh, boy. It's really jammed in there.
Mitchell : Yeah. Why don't you hop on in there, dad?

Kim : Hi, Luke. Where's Walt? It is like a sauna in here. How does he stand it?
Walt! I'm waiting for my hug!
Claire : I have some sad news about Walt. He's dead.
Kim : What?
Claire : He died last night.
Kim : Are you joking?
Claire : No. He had a heart attack.
Kim : A man died. You're... you're smiling.
Modern Family Season 3x20 page.5

Claire : I'm not smiling.
Luke : You are, mom. It's kinda creepy.
Delivery Man : Well, hello? Walt? What's going on? Something happen to
Walt?
Claire : Well, I'm sure you can imagine.
Delivery Man : He sick? He's in the hospital? Oh, my God. Just tell me.
Claire : Mm! Okay. He is... dead.
Delivery Man : He is?
Claire : Yeah, he's dead.

Alex : Please, no. He's already made me eat the world's greatest everything on
the menu. Dad, why are you acting like this? Is this about Walt dying?
Phil : No. It's about what he didn't do when he was alive... have a special bond
with his daughter. I don't want to be that kind of dad. I want to be Eugene
Cernan.
Alex : Who's Eugene cernan?
Phil : "Apollo 17" astronaut, last man on the moon, coolest dad of all time.
When he was leaving the moon, he reached down and wrote his daughter's
initials into the lunar surface. Since there's no atmosphere...

Delivery Man : What are you doing with your mouth?

Alex : There'll be there forever. Wow. So every time she looks in the sky, she
knows there's a message just for her.

Claire : Nothing.

Phil : Exactly. That's why dads everywhere hate Eugene Cernan.

Kim : She's smiling. She thinks it's funny.

Alex : Oh, no.

Claire : I don't. I don't think it's funny. I'm not smiling.

Phil : Okay, "hate's" a strong word. It's just... I'm trying to make... Oh. Oh, boy.
Honey. Okay. I really wanna help, but you know when someone yawns, it
makes you yawn?

Delivery Man : I'm not leaving this with you.
Claire : I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just found out my face does this.
Luke: Wow, mom. That was so wrong.

Alex : You're not gonna yawn, are you?

Claire : Well, it's... it's called a coping mechanism, Luke. Some people repress
their feelings and some people just smile. But d... it doesn't matter. Just put the
TV in the den. Let's get out of here.

Phil : I already yawned a little in my mouth.
Alex : Oh, God.

Luke : It doesn't go in the den. It goes right here. I can see it from my room.
Sometimes I'd wake up in the middle of the night and look down here. If the
TV was on, I knew he was up, and I don't know, I guess I'm gonna miss that.

Merle : Jay, I want to thank you for helping me do this. I know Cam
appreciates not having to do it all on his own. What? What's that face?

Claire : Yeah. That's... Yeah.

Merle : Sure.

Jay : You really wanna know?
Jay : Sometimes I think you treat my son like the woman in their relationship.

Francine : Is that any better?

Merle : What?

Phil : Yeah, it still feels just, you know, a little wobbly.

Jay : Like those watches. Cam's was all big and manly. The other one looked
like something Grace Kelly would wear.

Alex : Oh! Oh, my God. Okay, no, no, no. That's... that's fine. Thank you.
Thank you.
Phil : Okay, it's "go" time.

Merle : Well, that's just because Mitch has a more slender wrist than Cam
does. That's all.

Francine : Oh, hey, doc. It's okay. It's just a cramp. Can I get you guys anything
else?

Jay : It's skinny, not slender. And you're honestly telling me you don't cast
Mitch in the more ladylike role?
Modern Family Season 3x20 page.6

Merle : Are you saying Cam is the wife in this deal?
Jay : I don't think about it that way. It's not like it was in our day. Husband
went out to work. Wife stayed home with the kids.
Merle : That sounds like a clever way of saying "yes."
Jay : Fine. They're both equal. Neither one is the wife.

Haley : Oh, crap. Listen, Gloria. Okay, everything I told you technically was
not...
Gloria : You lied to me so that you could have a party without supervision!
Haley : Oh, I had plenty of supervision. He was running around all night with
his coasters and vacuum and his "make good choices" speech.

Merle : Yeah. Yeah. I know that in my head. It's just that it makes me feel a tiny
bit better to think that the person he's spending his life with is a tiny bit of a
woman.

Gloria : Good. Somebody needed to be responsible.

Jay : I get it. Every time I start to feel comfortable with this thing, some new
part comes up I gotta wrap my head around.

Manny : I'm in trouble?

Manny : Thank you.
Gloria : Not you. You take rules too seriously.

Merle : Yeah, I guess we got no choice.

Gloria : You are 13. You're not supposed to be vacuuming the party. You're
supposed to be enjoying the party.

Jay : Yep. We got two sons, and they're gay for each other.

Haley : Exactly.
Gloria : A party that you shouldn't have been having!

Phil : I'll take it slow on the way home. Don't worry. Canceling course for
adventure. Beep. Boop. Beep. Bop. Mm.
Alex : You know what I'll never forget? The time my dad spent the entire day
trying to create a special memory for me. Or when a pregnant lady slipped in
my vomit.
Phil : Hang on. I wanna do one thing before we go.
Claire : Hey, you on your way home?
Phil : Just about. How's everything there?
Claire : Actually, it's pretty great. I can't wait to see you.

Manny : It seems like you're sending mixed signals here.
Haley : Yeah, maybe I should get my friends and just leave.
Gloria : No, you're in trouble, little young lady. You're having this party!
Manny : What? They've been using glassware by the pool, putting feet on the
furniture, and begging girls to kiss each other.
Gloria : Yes! All the things that you should have been doing! Yeah, all those
things are fine. Go. Have fun and go crazy.
Haley : But he's gonna ruin my party.
Gloria : Two birds with one bullet.

Phil : Me, too. Okay. Let's hit it. I don't know. I feel like maybe we should get
some food on the way home.
Alex : Don't.
Phil : Maybe a nice tuna melt.
Alex : Stop it.
Manny : I did what I could, mom. It was a nightmare. I can't tell you how
many times I turned off the bathroom light.
Gloria : Haley!
Modern Family Season 3x20 page.7

3x21 : Planes, Train and Cars
Phil : How are you doing? Phil Danoughy. What do I have to get you to ask,
"What do I have to do to get you into this car today?"

Cameron : How did you miss that, Mitchell?
Mitchell : Mr. Conductor! I-I... What? I was purell-ing! And it's me! Why
would you toss it?
Cameron : Because my hands were full?

Salesman : Well, why don't we start with a test drive? I'll get the keys.

Mitchell : I want Bunny!

Phil : Sounds good. Right where I want him.

Cameron : I know. W... okay, I have an idea. Let's catch the next train and ride
it till it catches up.

Andre : Come here. Come look at this. This thing warns you if you deviate
from your lane. In my car, that's my wife. "Andre, if you try to kill me, I swear
I will kill you!"

Mitchell : They don't catch up. That's called a collision.
Cameron : Okay, well, do you have a better idea? You're the one that lost it.

Phil : Well, I guess this is what I'll be driving for the next 39 months.

Mitchell : No, you tossed it. He who tossed it lost it.

Andre : This is my D.N.A. talking, but you do not seem sufficiently excited
about the prospect of driving a new Cadillac.

Cameron : Don't try to clever your way out of this.

Phil : No, it's great. I've just leased the same thing forever. Part of me wants to
shake things up. I don't know. Get something like... like that.

Mitchell & Cameron : She means you.

Andre : Oh, wow.
Phil : Colonel Klink, that is nice.
Mitchell : We took Lily on her first train ride. Just a quick trip to Chinatown.
Cameron : I was worried she would think we were taking her back to
Vietnam, but she seemed okay.
Mitchell : Yeah, yeah. Possibly because she was an infant when she left
Vietnam. Also, Vietnam is not China.
Cameron : Well, I had a lollipop with me just in case.
Cameron : I love that we're doing this. It's important for her to explore the city
she lives in.
Mitchell : So much diversity. Keep your wallet in your front pocket.
Lily : My shoe's untied.
Cameron : Oh, sweetie, it is. Here, have a seat. Right here. There you go. Hey,
hold Bunny.
Mitchell : No! No, no, no, no, no, no!
Lily : Bunny!

Lily : Daddy lost Bunny.

Phil : Oh, I wanted a car like this since I was a kid.
Andre : Me, too.
Phil : I used to imagine the wind blowing through my perm, blasting some
Hall & Oates, maybe horsing around with my Mr. Microphone...
Andre : Yeah, we wouldn't have been friends back then. You should buy it.
Phil : No, it's not practical.
Andre : Practical? You never see a person on their deathbed saying, "I wish I'd
have been more practical." I see a lot of people on their deathbed, Phil. A lot.
Phil : I thought you operated on knees and elbows.
Andre : Phil, this is a nice car. And it's half the price of a new car. If you don't
buy it, I will.
Phil : What would Claire say?
Andre : You know what? Maybe we should find you something with a little
more lumbar support.
Phil : Yeah.
Andre : You know, with you not having a spine and all.
Phil : I have a spine.
Modern Family Season 3x21 page.1

Andre : Do you have a spine?

Phil : Luke, Luke, Luke... Where is she?

Phil : I have a spine.

Alex : Dad, I don't like this.

Salesman : So wanna take it for a spin?

Phil : Why not?

Phil : You know what? I'd rather take her for a spin. Let's get her top down
and see what she can do. I'm... no, I meant the convertible.

Alex : My friend Molly's dad bought a sports car, and now he lives in a studio
apartment and dates a girl who works at forever 21, which she won't be for
two years.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Andre : Hear that?
Phil : Honey, I'm not leaving your mom.

Manny : Well, I just talked to the concierge, and room service will save me a
bread pudding.

Luke : Might not be your call.

Jay : Load off my mind.

Haley : Oh, my God, it's so pretty! I love it! And I love you, and I promise I'll
take super good care of it!

Manny : You mock me, but "Travel and Leisure" says it's not to be missed.

Alex : Can I tell her? Please. I ask for so little.
Phil : Alex, be nice to your sister.

Jay : This weekend, we're going up to Pebble Beach. I'm gonna meet a bunch
of guys I played high school football with. Man, those were the good old days.
Gloria : Yeah, unless you were a woman, black, Hispanic, or gay.
Jay : True, but if you were a straight white guy who played football, you really
couldn't have a bad day.
Jay : Gloria? Hmm? Which watch should I pack? This one's showier. This one's
more expensive.
Gloria : Why do you care so much about a watch?
Jay : How do I say this without sounding like an ass? I'm kind of a legend to
these guys.
Gloria : Not like that.

Alex : It's dad's car, not yours.
Haley : What? But you're too old for this! It's just like last year when you
wouldn't take off those skinny jeans.
Alex : Wouldn't or couldn't?
Phil : Hey. I looked hot.
Andre : And you look hot in this car. Let me tell you something about your
dad. Your dad is a man who knows what he wants, and he gets it.
Claire : Oh.
Andre : At least that's what I heard. You know, I was there more as a friend
and an observer than anything.
Claire : Andre.
Andre : Hey, Claire.
Phil : Honey.

Phil : Hey! Who's your daddy?

Claire : Is this the new car?

Luke : Whoa! Whose car is this?

Phil : I know it looks impractical, but Andre's seen a lot of people die.

Phil : Mine!
Andre : I talked him into it.

Claire : I'm not upset. I'm not upset. It's a beautiful car. Just surprised you
didn't get the sedan, that's all. Beautiful.

Luke : Seriously? Mom's gonna let you have this?

Andre : Good seeing, you, Cl...
Modern Family Season 3x21 page.2

Claire : Mm. Beautiful.
Phil : What just happened?

Claire : How you doing there, sport?

Andre : She did not blink once.

Phil : Great. Yeah. Awesome. You know what's awesome? Is this car has the
engine in the trunk, so that means I get to... put these signs in the seat, which is
cool.

Phil : Do you wanna come in for a minute?
Andre : No, I gotta... you know, I gotta get to the wife.
Phil : Well, do you... Uh, do you need a ride or anything?
Andre : No. No, no, I'm gonna, uh, I'm... a jog.
Phil : Why... why are you running?
Andre : I'm just gonna jog!
Mitchell : Lily was up all night because she didn't have Bnny, which means
that we were up all night because she didn't have Bunny. God, she must have
cried for... How long was it, Cam? Cam. Cam. Hmm?
Cameron : Oh, sorry. Uh, last night was rough because Lily...
Mitchell : Covered it. Didn't have Bunny.
Gloria : Jay, tell me, why are we on the runway?
Jay : Surprise! We're taking a private plane.
Manny : Wow! I've never been on a private plane!
Gloria : And you never will. I am not getting on that little thing! What if the
rubber band snaps and we fall out of the sky?

Claire : Very cool.
Phil : Huh.
Claire : What?
Phil : Oh, nothing. My, uh, client just wants me to pick her up on the way to
the open house, which is great. I'll, uh, drop the sign off and just swing across
town to... Oh. She's bringing her mom and a designer.
Claire : Well, maybe they'll fit in the trunk.
Phil : Here it comes!
Claire : What? I was making a joke.
Phil : What's your game, woman?
Claire : I have no game. You're an adult. You can make your own choices.
Phil : Since when?
Claire : Do you wanna borrow the minivan?
Phil : Yes, please.
Claire : Okay, fine. Then you're gonna have to pick up the kids from school.
Phil : Okay, I can't take it. If you got something to say, just say it.

Jay : It's perfectly safe. It's a legitimate airline!

Claire : I have nothing to say.

Pilot : Hey, folks. Whoa. Nobody said three. All right. Before we take off, I'm
gonna need to get everyone's weight here.

Phil : That just says it all.
Claire : Well... Okay.

Jay : No problem. I'm about 190.
Pilot : Okay.
Gloria : Oh, yeah. In that case, I'm 275.
Jay : Gloria, I would never put you and Manny in danger. Now come on! Trust
me on this! Beautiful.

Manny : All... all right. Thank you, Serena. See you tonight. Good news... they
rescheduled my massage for the morning. Bad news... it's a dude.
Jay : Don't blame me. It's your mom's fault.
Gloria : Do you know how many people have died in these planes? John
Denver, Patsy Cline, Ritchie Valens.

Jay : It's American music the whole way, and I don't wanna hear a word.
Modern Family Season 3x21 page.3

Jay : I've heard you sing. I think you're safe. All right, look, the welcome
dinner starts in four hours. It's a 5-hour drive. No bathroom breaks. Yeah, I
think you're gonna want to hold on to that cup. Damn it!
Gloria : What was that?

Claire : Maybe I was a teeny bit mad. So I blew off my errands and headed up
the coast. It was my turn to be irresponsible. And luckily, I had sunscreen in
my purse.

Jay : Giant pothole. The dash is lighting up like a Christmas tree. Tire's blown!
This never would have happened if we were in the air!

Mechanic : Well, your strut's shot, and we can't get parts for at least a day.

Gloria : If this had happened in the air, we wouldn't be in the air. We would be
in rock 'n' roll heaven!

Jay : Fantastic. I don't suppose there's any place you can rent cars anywhere
around here?

Cameron : Okay, what do you think? I'm gonna put these in the subway.

Mechanic : Know what, sir? We're not some one-horse town. Of course you
can rent a car. It just happens to be out for the day.

Mitchell : Okay, it looks like, uh, Lily's missing and we're offering $25 to get
her back.
Cameron : Oh, don't be ridiculous. No one in their right mind... Okay. That's
all I see now. How about this one?
Mitchell : Okay. Um... "Missing... stuffed bunny. Brown and white fur.
Sympathetic eyes." What are sympathetic eyes?

Jay : Unbelievable. We're gonna miss the whole weekend.
Gloria : I am sorry, Jay. I know how much you mean to those guys, and I know
how much they want to see you. I'm so sorry.
Mechanic : Uh, excuse me. You are... so pretty. And if you really need to get
somewhere, maybe I can help you out.
Gloria : Ay, yes, please! Thank you! Anything!

Cameron : Not those.
Mitchell : I just... I don't really love the idea of our phone number being up in
the subway.

Mechanic : Check it out. Restored it myself.

Cameron : Okay, let's play a different game. How about I be the problem, and
you be the solution?

Gloria : No. I did not get in the little plane at the little airport! I'm not gonna
get in this... takka-takka-takka-takka flown by that guy that couldn't fix our
car!

Mitchell : I'm sorry. I shouldn't be so critical. I know you're just trying to... Got
it! Just came up with a better idea. Took me less than five seconds.

Jay : Gloria, it's either this, or we're in the motel.

Claire : I can't hear you. What? Window. I don't know... Gah! What did I do?
Oh. Oh, my. Yes. Hi.

Jay : You know, when I met you, you were eating cereal out of a bucket.

Man : Hey, nice car.
Claire : Thank you.
Man : You gonna drive up the coast, or...
Claire : Oh, no. I'm gonna do some errands, actually. Yeah, 'cause other people
might go and buy a crazy car with an engine in the... in the trunk, but not me.
No. I'm responsible. Mm-hmm. We have three kids. You can't pick up three
kids in this car. You can't. You... it... it... I'll get you... catch ya. I'm going!

Manny : I don't like the sound of that. A lot of amenities disappear when an
"H" becomes an "M."

Mitchell : Hey, Lily, guess what?
Lily : What?
Mitchell : Uh, we just heard from Bunny.
Cameron : This is a terrible idea.

Modern Family Season 3x21 page.4

Mitchell : No, it's fantastic. Bunny said he's on an amazing adventure having
the time of his life, and that you should pick one of his best friends to sleep
with while he's gone.
Lily : Bunny doesn't talk.
Cameron : This is going great.
Mitchell : He does now, because... because he took talking lessons. So what do
you think, huh? Turtle or giraffe or, uh, little reindeer?
Lily : Where's Bunny now?
Mitchell : Uh, St. Louis.
Lily : Why?
Mitchell : He's visiting his girlfriend.
Lily : He doesn't have a girlfriend. He has a boyfriend! I want Bunny!
Mitchell : Okay. No, no, Lily. Lily, uh, what about Miss, uh, Teddy Bear? Huh?
No? Uh, Dr. Tiger? No? Mr. Fish?
Lily : I want Bunny. I'm going to St. Louis.
Cameron : Really? You don't know Nemo? It's on an endless loop in the den.
Mitchell : I have a job.

Haley : Corey. He is so clingy.
Phil : But, you know, there's something about driving your kids around.
You're in the front, they're in the back. They forget you're there, and you learn
so much. You're like Sigourney Weaver in "Gorillas in the Mist." Except gorillas
make less noise chewing.
Claire : Once I hit the coast highway, I didn't stop. I turned off my cell phone. I
ate fish tacos for lunch. It was insane! I haven't felt that free in years. All my
stress completely disappeared... And so did my keys.
Mitchell : I'm sorry, but... these signs are ridiculous.
Cameron : Oh, you're right. I should have used Helvetica. It much better
represents the urgency of our situation.
Mitchell : No, the lengths that we're going to for a stuffed animal. You know,
Cam, maybe it's time Lily learned about loss.
Cameron : No, she's 3, and I know. Do you know how many times I had to say
good-bye to a furry friend on the farm?
Mitchell : And didn't it make you stronger?

Luke : And then Bodie kicked it to me, and I dribbled it past Michael and got it
to Tyler...
Phil : I was bummed not to be in my new cool car, so I wasn't joking around
with the kids like I usually do.

Cameron : Yeah, because I was a growing boy and they were chock-full of
protein. But it was still heartbreaking.
Mitchell : It builds character. You know, once, when I was a kid, my dad left
my Luke Skywalker doll on an airplane, and I was so angry...
Cameron : Wait, which... which Luke? Shorty robe or dress blacks?
Mitchell : Shorty robe.

Luke : And I would've scored if that kid didn't trip me. I can't believe the ref
didn't see it.
Leon : I bet Olivia saw it. She's always watching you when you play.

Cameron : Oh, my.
Mitchell : And you know what he did to get it back? Not a damn thing. Nope.
He didn't lift one pudgy finger to make a single phone call, and I got over it.

Luke : Yeah, I know. It's like she's in love with soccer.

Cameron : Yeah, well, I want you and Lily to have the same healthy
relationship you and your father have. For sure.

Haley : Ugh. Stop texting me!

Mitchell : All right, give me these flyers. I'm gonna take everything to this side
of the homeless guy.

Alex : What?

Cameron : Mitchell!
Modern Family Season 3x21 page.5

Mitchell : Sorry, what are we supposed to say now? Home-challenged? Or...

Gloria : Jay, this is getting crazy. Is it worth it?

Cameron : No, look!

Jay : I wanna see the old gang.

Mitchell : Oh, my God! It's Bunny! Oh, Lily's gonna be so happy. Oh, that's so
great. Go ahead and get it.
Cameron : What, me?

Gloria : Do you wanna see them or you want to show off to them? The private
plane, the fancy watch. You still want to feel that you're the big kahuna on the
campus.

Mitchell : Yeah.

Jay : That's not it. That's not even a thing.

Cameron : Why should I go and get it?

Gloria : You know what? I'm taking Manny home. If you want to go in the
takka-takka-takka-takka, okay. Go to Pebble Beach by yourself.

Mitchell : Well, I-I'm not gonna do it.
Cameron : Why?
Mitchell : I spotted it. You're closer.
Cameron : It's your journey. Luke Skywalker? Pattern-breaking? Your father?
Get in there.
Mitchell : Fine. Sir... hi, sir. Hello, you... you... Hello. Yeah. Hello. He-hello?
Sir... I-I can't...
Cameron : Oh, for God sakes!
Cameron : Let her hate us. You turned out great.
Mitchell : I did, didn't I?

Jay : No, what? That's not the plan.
Gloria : If you wanna go there so bad, that's the only way you're gonna get
there.
Jay : I'm not trying to get me there. I'm trying to get you there!
Gloria : What?
Jay : Look... I may have exaggerated the size... kahuna I was. I may not...
technically have been a kahuna. I was shy, and I spent most of my time... on
the bench.
Gloria : But you always made it sound like you...

Cameron : You're a big lawyer.

Jay : Oh, I know what I made it sound like. People didn't expect much from
me, and, um... They certainly didn't expect me to end up with... somebody like
you.

Manny : This is not the massage I had in mind.

Gloria : So this is all about you parading me around like a trophy?

Jay : All right. Okay. In about an hour, a train goes through town that will get
us close to pebble beach. Now it's not technically a-a passenger train, so it
won't be stopping.

Jay : Yes.

Gloria : What?

Manny : Oh, good. If we get out of here in the next ten minutes, we don't have
to pay for the second hour.

Jay : So we gotta get running real good. No high-heeled shoes. And it wouldn't
be wrong if we took that blanket with us, either, huh? So what do you say?
Anybody up for a hobo adventure?
Manny : If we're voting, I'm a "no."
Gloria : Manny, we're gonna be right back. We're gonna get some ice from the
machine in the parking lot.
Manny : Classy.

Gloria : Why didn't you say so? I can be a trophy! Come on. We need to get
this up to Pebble Beach. Manny! We're leaving! Get ready!

Phil : How you doing there, sport?
Claire : I'm sorry.
Phil : That's okay.
Claire : Thanks.
Phil : So... Whatcha doing all the way up here? Did someone snap?
Modern Family Season 3x21 page.6

Claire : A little. Yeah. I was mad at you for buying that stupid sports car.

Lily : Mine!

Phil : I knew it!
Claire : And I was wrong. It's a great car. God, I had the best day. Phil, I did
cartwheels.
Phil : Without me?

Manny : But they're wrong. It's all about the destination, especially when the
destination is your amazing oceanfront hotel. Thank you again, Serena.
Warmest regards, Manny Delgado.

Claire : Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Jay : What's he doing?

Phil : Hey, did you know there's a girl with a crush on Luke?

Gloria : He's sending flowers to the concierge.

Claire : Olivia. Yeah.

Jay : Oh, jeez.

PHil : Oh, and Haley's totally done with Corey.

Manny : Hey... Credit card.

CLaire : That's new.
Phil : Alex is teaching herself Chinese so she'll be useful when they finish
buying us.

Andre : She wore you down, didn't she?

Claire : She's so weird.

Andre : It's sad. She got you to believe that.

Phil : I really want to be able to drive the kids around. I need a bigger car for
work. I made a mistake.

Phil : No, I... Turns out I'm just not a convertible guy.

Claire : No, you didn't. You bought it for a reason. When did we stop coming
to the beach?

Phil : Right?

Phil : I think it was when Alex started printing out water quality reports.
Claire : She'll be China's problem soon.
Phil : You know... We don't need a sports car to get out here.
Claire : Mm.
Phil : We should just make a pact. Once a month, we get out to the beach.
Claire : And we tell everyone we're running errands.
Phil : So you didn't get to the dry cleaner?

Phil : This is not about Claire. I really want to sell you the car.

Andre : Well, your loss is my gain. It's a sweet ride, Phil.
Andre : It really is. Uh-oh.
Phil : What?
Andre : I'm getting, like, a whiff of mildew.
Phil : I don't smell anything.
Andre : Yep. That's mildew.
Phil : Huh?
Andre : This car's been in the flood. It's a Katrina car! I'm offended that you
tried to sell me a Katrina car, Phil!
Phil : Your wife won't let you have a convertible, will she?

Manny : They say the important thing in life isn't the destination. It's the
journey, the challenges you face along the way... The unexpected twists and
turns... The disappointments you overcome.

Andre : We will never know, 'cause I'm afraid to ask. See you later, Phil.
Phil : Why are you running again?

Cameron : Look what I found on the Internet.
Mitchell : Oh, my God! It's Luke Skywalker in his shorty robe! I love it, Cam...

3x22 : Disneyland

Jay : Really? Those shoes?
Gloria : What?

Luke : Please, please, please, please.
Alex : Okay, what is this?
Luke : We're making sure I'm tall enough to ride all the rides at Disneyland
without having to spike up my hair.
Phil : Buddy... we are good to go.
Luke : Sweet!
Phil : I have been waiting for this day ever since the doctor pointed to the
ultrasound of your mom's womb and said, "either that's a fifth limb, or you
got a boy."
Haley : Okay, no. Gross.
Claire : All right... I want everybody to eat a lot at home because "the happiest
place on earth" is also home to the most expensive churro on Earth.
Phil : Come on. This is gonna be awesome. Who doesn't love a day at
Disneyland?
Manny : Can't you and mom go without me?
Jay : You're the kid. I think we need you to get in.
Manny : Well, it couldn't come on a worst day. The technology sector is
tanking.
Manny : We're doing a stock market project in school, and today's the last day.
We all get a thousand fake dollars to invest, and as the market closed
yesterday, I'm in the lead. I may not be the tallest or the most athletic, but
someday I will be the richest, which is good because the ladies love that, and
I've grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle.

Jay : Do you know how much walking you have to do at Disneyland? Why do
you think they have so many fat people on scooters?
Gloria : I like wearing the high heels. I'm fine.
Jay : It's just like that jacket you refuse to bring when I say, "take a jacket."
"Don't tell me what to do! I'm fine!" Huh? And you're not fine. You're cold and
shivering, and I look like the jerk who won't give his wife a jacket, so I do, and
then I'm cold and shivering, and I brought a jacket.
Gloria : Are you done with your boring jacket story? Because we're going to
hit traffic.
Jay : Tell you one thing. I'm not gonna give you my shoes.
Claire : Ah! That must be Ethan.
Haley : Who's Ethan?
Claire : Didn't I tell you? My friend Bethenny's nephew is coming with us
today. He moved to town to go to college. He's very nice, very smart, big
hockey player.
Haley : I know what you're doing.
Alex : Really? She was so subtle.
Claire : Haley has a thing for bad boys, which was so me.
Phil : Clearly.
Claire : So if she's going to be leaving the nest soon, we'd prefer it was not on
the back of a motorcycle.
Phil : My college roommate had a motorcycle. Man, I had some good times on
the back of that thing.

Jay : Do you really wants girls who only want you for your money?
Manny : I'd like to have that option.
Gloria : Manny, put the stock away and put your ears on.

Haley : I can't believe you did this. I'm not gonna babysit Bethenny's nephew.
Alex can have him.

Manny : Mom, I don't think you have to wear one of these.

Alex : Okay, I don't need your rejects.

Gloria : Be a kid! Put them on!

Claire : Hi. Hi, Ethan! I'm so glad you could make it.
Modern Family Season 3x22 page.1

Ethan : Thanks for inviting me.

Cameron : Oh, okay, wait just a second here, everybody. All right.

Claire : Sure.

Gloria : Is that a leash?

Alex : Hi. I'm Al...

Cameron : No, it's a child safety tether. This way, sweetie.

Haley : My 14-year-old sister. Ethan, was it?

Mitchell : It... it's a leash. Don't... don't judge us.

Ethan : Yeah.

Cameron : Go on.

[OPENING CREDTIS]

Cameron : We have a runner.
Mitchell : Lily is going through a phase-- at least... Oh, we hope it's a phase.

Haley : And that's my grandpa and his wife Gloria and her son Manny.

Cameron : She bolts every chance she gets.

Ethan : Wow. You guys have a big family.
Haley : Big family.

Cameron : Lily! Lily! Lily!

Claire : She likes him!
Cameron : Yeah, who wouldn't? Where'd you find him, a Tommy Hilfiger
catalog?

Cameron : So we had no choice to put her on a child safety tether.
Mitchell : It's a leash. And we did have a choice.

Claire : He got a 2200 on his S.A.T.s. And those eyes...
Mitchell : Okay, did you get him for Haley or for you?

Cameron : Lily, sweetie, don't pull.

Claire : Mitchell.

Jay : Lily, heel!

Mitchell : You know, I haven't been here since dad brought us when we were
kids.

Mitchell : Dad.

Claire : Ohh, yeah. Remember? You cried in the Abraham Lincoln thing.
Jay : Hey, he's a great president, and it was the first robot I ever saw.
Jay : When Claire and Mitchell were young, their mom and I were gonna take
them to Disneyland. But that morning, Dede and I got in this huge fight over
something or other... surprise, surprise... and I ended up taking them on my
own. Claire's biggest fear was running into the evil queen. My biggest fear was
that I married her.

Jay : If I'd had known you guys were gonna do this, I'd have brought Stella.
Mitchell : It was Cam's idea.
Cameron : So much for the united front. I'll have you know, despite all your
jokes, Lily enjoys it. Okay, sweetie, you're not helping. You're not helping.
Alex : Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You guys, is that Dylan?
Haley : What?
Claire : Oh, jeez.
Haley : Dylan?!

Phil : Okay, people over 46 inches, first stop... Indiana Jones!

Dylan : Oh. Hey!

Luke : Have fun on the teacups, Lily.

Haley : Uh, what are you... I didn't even know you were in town.

Jay : Okay, let's do this.

Dylan : Either did I... Know you were in town. This town. Anaheim.
Modern Family Season 3x22 page.2

Haley : I thought you were still in Wyoming.

Gloria : Let's go to the jungle cruise. It's right there.

Dylan : I was, uh... But, um... Oh, shoot. You know, I, uh, gotta meet up with
some friends and I'm... really late. It was nice to see you, Haley, and
everybody.

Jay : Why? Tired of walking in those heels?

Mitchell : Hi.

Gloria : No. You tired of being with a hot wife?

Ethan : I'm Ethan. It's nice to meet you.

Cameron : Well, well, well. What do you know? Another caring parent with a
child safety tether. See? We're not the only people who use them. Hi! Aren't
they adorable?

Dylan : And polite dude I don't know.

Woman : Oh, and look at your cutie!

Ethan : Did Haley used to date that guy or something?

Cameron : Oh, well, yes. She just wanted to say hi.

Alex : Yep. You date her, that's the club you're joining.

Woman : Oh. Sorry. They're a little feisty today.

Haley : Of course he would still look amazing.

Cameron : Oh! No problem. She's friendly.

Claire : Does he? I hadn't noticed. Did you know that Ethan plays the
trumpet? No great surprise with those lips of his, huh?

Woman : Rex, gentle.

Mitchell : Coo-coo-ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson.

Woman : Yeah.

Dylan : And dude I don't know.

Mitchell : Oh, his... his name's Rex, huh?
Cameron : Oh, okay. Lily, no, sweetie. Lily, um...

Phil : Okay, buddy, moment of truth.

Woman : Oh. Sorry. He... he just gets excited.

Luke : Yes!
Phil : This is gonna be so awesome!

Cameron : Oh, yeah, no... oh, no problem. Lily, stop moving, sweetie. Stop
moving.

Luke : Yeah!

Mitchell : Okay, you got this.

Phil : In 45 minutes, this is gonna be so awesome!

Cameron : Okay. Okay. Good girl! Good girl! Sorry.

Luke : Yeah!
Manny : Look, Reuben, I have some underperformers I have to unload, and I
don't have access to a computer. Log in as moneydelgado...
Gloria : Manny!
Manny : By all means, Reuben, go get a popsicle while the Nikkei closes. I
wanna be a pauper. Mom, my stocks just took a dive.
Gloria : Your phone is about to take a dive.
Jay : Come on! Where do we want to go next?
Alex : Oh! Ethan and I want to try the haunted mansion.
Claire : There is no you and Ethan.

Jay : You know what the fight with Dede was about? I taped a football game
over an episode of "Dallas." Who bails on a family trip to Disneyland over
something like that? Ironically, Dallas was playing in the game. And I
remember pointing that out to her, and then I remember a video cassette flying
at my head.
Ethan : You do not play the cello.
Alex : I do. Even geekier... I'm good.
Ethan : Okay, answer me this...
Alex : I will answer you this.
Modern Family Season 3x22 page.3

Ethan : Why do people carry cellos around? You know, people aren't expected
to lug a piano around. What's the cutoff?

Jay : The fluid in your inner ear is thickening. That's what happens when you
get old.

Alex : I know, right? Like, go where the cello is.

Phil : It is?

Claire : Oh, look at this. I think I've inadvertently set up my 14-year-old with a
college boy.

Jay : Yeah, you can't take the motion. I gotta pop a dramamine to get in my
swivel chair.

Jay : The boy was your doing?

Phil : That is not it. I'm king of the roller coasters. I think I just put too big of a
whipped cream smile on my pancake this morning.

Claire : Yes. Yes, and he was perfect, and Haley was into him until, of course,
we ran into Dylan. I mean, come on, dad. What are the odds of that
happening?
Jay : It's a small world.
Claire : Yes, it is.
Jay : You see what I did there?

Luke : You guys wanna go on Matterhorn?
Jay : Luke, I think me and your dad are gonna sit this one out, maybe get one
them big pickles.
Phil : No! You're gonna have to eat that pickle on your own, Jay. I still got a
few good years left. Luke, wait up! I'll race you there! I'm good. I'm good.

Claire : I did.
Jay : 'Cause it's a ride.
Claire : I got it. Got it, dad. I got it. It's so frustrating because... I know I can't
run Haley's like for her, but if she would let me, I would be so good at it.
Jay : Right, 'cause parents always know what's best for their kids. You
remember that nice girl at the office I tried to fix Mitch up with?
Claire : No offense, dad, but I think I probably have a better sense of what my
kids need than you did.
Jay : I think it's cute you think that.
Luke : Mom! It was so awesome! The jeep was jerking around... And... and
there was a lot of sharp turns and big drops.
Claire : Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Phil : It just kept going.
Claire : Wow. You okay?
Phil : Great. Why wouldn't I be?
Claire : Because you're kinda leaning on me.
Phil : Well, isn't that what a marriage is?
Claire : Ohh. Oh, Alex, stop touching him.
Jay : Oh. You look like hell.
Phil : I'm feeling a little dizzy. I think that ride did something to me.

Mitchell : Okay, everybody's looking at us. I haven't been judged by this many
people since I forgot my canvas bags at whole foods.
Cameron : Yeah, well, maybe they're staring because we have what they want.
Mitchell : Whoa! Oh, a pet daughter. 'Cause that...
Cameron : You know, I don't care what people think. If I thought it would
keep my daughter safe, I would have a kangaroo pouch sewn into my midriff.
Mitchell : That's gonna work out really well for you as a single parent. Okay,
we just got a glare from Mr. Socks-with-sandals. All right, that's it. Lily, I'm
gonna take off this leash.
Cameron : I think it's a mistake.
Mitchell : But I don't want you to run away, 'cause that would be very, very
unsafe, and if we lost you, you'd be very scared, and we'd be very sad. Okay?
Lily : Okay.
Mitchell : All right. See, Cam? You treat her like a human being and she acts
like one.
Lily : Chip 'n Dale!
Cameron : Oh, great. Now she's chasing squirrels. Lily!
Mitchell : Honey, come on!
Cameron : Lily! Lily!
Modern Family Season 3x22 page.4

Jay : Hey! How was Splash Mountain?
Gloria : It was great! Maybe we go again.
Manny : No, thanks. There was no reception in there. You know how many
bars I had? Zip-a-Dee-doo-dah. Reuben, talk to me!
Jay : Must be nice to get out of those shoes for a minute.
Gloria : I don't know what you talking about.
Jay : Nothing. I'm just making conversation. Hey. Check it out. I bought one of
those souvenir photos with you and Manny on the ride. Boy, it looks like
you're having a good time. Wait a minute. What's that in your hand? Are those
shoes?
Gloria : I'm not even sure that that is us, Jay.
Jay : Why are you walking around in pain? Just admit the shoes were a bad
idea.
Gloria : I am not in pain. I just didn't want my favorite walking shoes to get
wet there.
Jay : Okay, my bad. Well, we've gotta meet everybody in Tomorrowland, so
we'd better get movin' 'cause it's all the way on the other side of the park.

Gloria : Are you crazy? I cannot walk around in public with these... things.
They're so yellow and so ugly. And... and they're so softy and so comfortable.
Jay, what is this? Thank you for going shopping for me. Thank you for
worrying about my feet. Thank you for giving me your jacket when I'm cold.
You're such a good man, Jay. Thank you.
Jay : Wow. I didn't expect you to be so... So nice.
Gloria : Why are you so surprised?
Jay : Now please don't go all Latin on me when I say this. Is it possible you get
angry from time to time because you're always wearing... uncomfortable
shoes?
Gloria : Maybe. Can you get me a couple of more? Maybe they have purple?
Jay : Whatever you want, honey.
Claire : All I'm saying is, it seemed like you were pretty into Ethan until Dylan
showed up.
Haley : Don't get me wrong. Ethan's nice, but he's no Dylan.
Claire : Maybe that's a good thing?

Gloria : I'm fine. You just try to keep up with us.

Haley : Why? Because Dylan's a free spirit? He's too edgy for you? He plays
by his own rules?

Jay : I can't take this.

Claire : Oh, my God.
Haley : What?

Luke : Dad, throw your hands up! It's fun!
Phil : Oh, yeah, it is fun!
Manny : Reuben, if you heard about that stock at a birthday party, it's already
too late.

Claire : I beg of you to turn around and experience with me the greatest
moment of my life. Your rebel boyfriend's a Dapper Dan.
Haley : Maybe that's not him.
Dapper Dan : Dylan!
Dylan : Uh, uh, sorry. Sorry. Um...

Jay : Gloria! Gloria, sit down for a second.

Claire : It certainly seems like him.

Gloria : I'm fine, Jay.

Haley : Oh, my God. He looked like those old pictures of dad from High
School.

Jay : Please? Look... You may not be in pain... But I'm in pain just thinking
you're in pain. So humor me for one minute.
Gloria : What are those?

Ethan : So anyway, I've really been into street art lately.

Jay : There wasn't a big selection at the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique.

Alex : Oh, there's a really great exhibit downtown. I'll take you.
Modern Family Season 3x22 page.5

Haley : Oh, on what, your razor scooter? Mom wants you.

Luke : So do you still wanna talk or...

Alex : I-I-I...

Phil : No, go. Ride Space Mountain. Hey! Hey! At the end, when they take a
picture, do something hilarious for both of us. You're gonna die. When you see
it, not 'cause you're old.

Haley : Ethan! I've been looking all over for you!
Jay : I remember I was on Pirates of the Caribbean, and this whole fight with
Dede was really eating at me. And there was this angry animatronic wench
with a rolling pin, chasing some poor pirate around. They were on a track,
running in circles, so he could never get away from her. And I remember
thinking, I can't save you, buddy, but I'm getting off this ride.

Mitchell : Lily! Lily, stop! Dad! Dad, grab her!
Jay : Hey, I gotcha, you little monkey!
Mitchell : Thank you. Hey, Cam, I got her. We're in Fantasyland. Where are
you? Okay, it's Toontown, not Toonton. You've been watching too much PBS.
Thank you. All right, honey, come here.

Luke : And... and we were going around a corner, and I was screaming and I
swallowed a bug. Oh, being tail is everything that I dreamed it would be.
What should we do next?

Lily : I don't like this thing.

Phil : Sit down.

Jay : Well, the leash is not the answer. You want my help?

Luke : Where we gonna sit down?

Mitchell : Yes, please!

Phil : The ground. Here, this is good right here. Oh!
Luke : Are you okay, dad?

Jay : 'Cause I can fix this for you in about two minutes. Come on, baby girl.
Come with me. We'll be right back.

Phil : No, I'm not okay. I hate to tell you this, but these rides are killing me.

Gloria : Okay.

Luke : B-but you're the king of roller coasters.

Mitchell : Where we going? Oh, this way?

Phil : I know! Something happens when you get older. Guess you can't take it.
One of my favorite things in the world is doing stupid fun stuff with you, like
pogo stick basketball or trying to get a swing to go all the way around.

Gloria : Manny, you don't sound very happy for a kid that is flying an
elephant.

Luke : Next time, we should sit on a fire extinguisher.
Phil : Yes, or a bottle of coke and some mentos. Honestly, though, the way I'm
feeling right now, I don't know if there's gonna be a next time.
Luke : Dad, we can always find cool stuff to do. Even if you're old and in a
wheelchair, I'll take you to the mall and push you as fast as you wanna go.
Phil : Really? You'd do that?
Luke : Heck, yeah. And we'll pop some wheelies, too.
Phil : That sounds fun.
Luke : And I'll take you to the top of a huge hill and just let go.
Phil : Okay, we'll nail down the specifics later, but that... that's really nice.

Mitchell : Yeah? Well, I don't like running like a crazy person through
Downton Disney... Downtown Disney. I don't know what to do.

Manny : I lost to Durkas. It's not fair. He wanted to buy IBM because he
thought it was funny to say.
Gloria : Well, I'm glad that you lost. Fake money has changed you. Where is
the Manny that used to stop to smell the roses?
Manny : He took a bath on a solar start-up in San Jose.
Gloria : You have been so busy burying your face in your phone that you
barely said hello to your family, you gave Winnie the Pooh the cold shoulder,
and you haven't even noticed that pretty girl in the blue elephant that has been
smiling at you.
Manny : Not my type, but still it's nice to be noticed.
Modern Family Season 3x22 page.6

Gloria : You see what happens when you're not burying your head in
business?

Ethan : Hey, what's going on?

Manny : You're right. I'll try to be more present. What the heck's on your feet?

Dylan ; I still love her, Ethan.

Gloria : They're slippers! They're like pillows.

Ethan : Okay, how do you know my name?

Jay : Attagirl. You're welcome.

Dylan : It's Dylan. Look, I don't wanna harsh your day, but I never stopped
loving Haley and I never will!

Haley : Nothing.

Cameron : Look. Your dad got her baby high heels, which we said we were
never gonna let her wear.

Ethan : I-is this some sort of joke?

Lily : I love 'em.

Haley : Dylan, let's not do this now.

Cameron : You look gorgeous, sweetie. Oh, my gosh. You felt people judged
us before? Wait till they meet little Miss Anaheim.

Dylan : It has to be now. I've got a parade at 3:00.

Mitchell : Who cares? Look at her. She can barely move. Thank you, dad.
Jay : You know what? She's got pretty good gams for a 3-year-old.
Haley : Cheese!
Ethan : Got it. Thanks, Little John.
Haley : Thank you!
Ethan : Ooh, they have corn dogs. We gotta get one before we go back. They
are legendary. I'll be right back.
Haley : Okay.
Dylan : Haley! It's me. Dylan. I'm in the bear suit. I borrowed it to talk to you.
Haley : Why are you dancing like that?
Dylan : This is what Little John does. Maybe. I don't know what movie this
dude is from. I'm not even supposed to be talking to you.
Haley : Well, I'm not talking to you.
Dylan : No, you can talk.
Haley : I know, but I'm mad. You came back to town and didn't even call me.
Dylan : I was embarrassed. I lost my job at the dude ranch, and I wanted to
get my act together first.
Haley : But the four dweebs on a bike act?
Dylan : Hey, the Dapper Dans are a main street tradition since 1959.

Dylan : Do I look like I'm joking?

Ethan : Hey, seriously, dude, back off.
Dylan : Okay, that was my face. And you're the one who needs to back off.
Haley : You...
Dylan : Okay. This thing's kinda heavy. I can't get up.
Claire : Ethan? Ethan, what is going on? What are you doing?
Dylan : Uh, hi, Mrs. Dunphy. Help me up.
Claire : No.
Dylan : If I could get up, I would... uhh!
Cameron : Come on, Lily sweetie. Keep up, honey.
Claire : Come on. Phil, you don't look like you're doing very well.
Phil : Maybe because I officially became an old man back there at Thunder
Mountain.
Claire : Oh, my goodness. You are burning up. You might have the flu.
Phil : A bunch of guys at work had the flu, and we all drink orange juice out of
the same carton. We should get cups. Luke, did you hear that?! I have the flu!
Jay : Glad we didn't share that pickle.
Haley : Hey, everybody.
Alex : Oh, hey, hey, guys. Where's Ethan?
Haley : Oh, he's staying. He ran into some friends. But Dylan got fired, so...
don't freak out. We have to give him a ride home. And we're back together.
Modern Family Season 3x22 page.7

Phil : Yay.
Jay : Hey, no one goes home till we hit the Lincoln thing.
Luke : Yawn.
Claire : Don't even try to fight it.
Mitchell : Yeah, he made us go when we were kids.
Jay : Come on, people! It's a robotic president! What's not to love?
Luke : A robotic president?
Jay : So my plan was, drive Claire and Mitchell home, put them to bed, pour
myself a big tumbler of scotch, and tell Dede it was over. But on the way out,
we made one last stop.
Robotic President : If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be its author
and finisher. As a nation of free men, we must live through all times...
Jay : I don't know what happened. Maybe it's what robot Lincoln said about a
man's duty or keeping the union together. Maybe I just chickened out. But I
realized that staying with my kids was more important than leaving my wife.
Now that's not the right decision for everyone, but it was the right decision for
me.
Robotic President : And in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as
we understand it.
Jay : So I stuck it out until they were grown...
Gloria : Jay, you want to join me in the jacuzzi?
Jay : And the universe rewarded me.
Luke : Here we go! Hey, dad, roller coast fist bump. What was that? Is this
gonna be so awesome! Close your eyes. It makes it more fun.
Phil : Oh, yeah. That is more fun.

3x23 : Tableau Vivant

Alex : Please. She's a gym teacher. She is to teaching what Dr. Seuss is to
medicine.

Claire : Phil, honey, you're still up.

Claire : And to think she didn't like you. You? What's your problem?

Phil : Okay, how does this sound? Mitchell, I love you very much, I not only
love you, but admire you, and someday I hope to...

Luke : Nothing. I'm just excited for tomorrow.

Claire : Are you firing him or proposing to him? Honey, this was supposed to
be a part-time job. He was gonna be done in the summer anyway. Just be
direct.

Luke : I'm getting a medal at school because I put out a fire. Maybe that's what
I should be when I grow up... A professional medal-getter.

Phil : I should have warned him. How do you tell someone they have a
reputation for being lazy?

Professor : Luke, what happened?

Claire : Mitchell? Lazy?
Phil : Yeah. Yeah. He handed in a couple of contracts late, but I didn't want to
say anything because he's practically doing this for free. I can't do this! This
isn't the face of a cold-blooded hatchet man. Will you do it?
Alex : Hey.
Claire : Oh, I'm sorry. Did we wake you up?
Alex : No, I was up. I'm worried about tomorrow.
Alex : My art teacher acts like I don't exist, but I have one last chance to
impress him at our year-end art fair. A few students are doing living versions
of famous paintings. I've chosen this one, and I'm using my own family.
Brilliant, right? When I told him, he said, "that's nice, Alice." It's been a year.
Alice? Really?

Luke : I don't know. I was just walking by and I smelled flames.
Manny : I was there.
Manny : I don't like this. We're not supposed to be in here.
Luke : Just keep a lookout! We're ten seconds away from creating luketonium.
Oh, crap!
Manny : Look what you did!
Professor : Luke, what happened?
Luke : I don't know. I was just walking by and I smelled flames.
Claire : Okay, guys, you're gonna be dragging tomorrow if you don't go to bed
right now. Let's go. Go.
Luke : Fine. Come on, Alice.

Alex : No.

Phil : I'll be up in a minute. "Mitchell, I can't tell you how hard... How hard
this..." No, that's... no, it's not personal enough. Okay, okay. "I can't tell you
how hurt and angry this makes me, but you've been late too many times. I'll
need your keys."

Claire : Are you sure? Because I've seen the way you look at him...

Haley : Daddy, no! I'm so sorry!

Alex : Sounds like you're the one with the crush! I've just never had a teacher
not like me before.

Phil : Honey, I didn't hear you come downstairs. You couldn't sleep, either?

Claire : Honey, do you think you're nervous because you've got a little crush
on Mr. Jarvis?

Phil : Well, Ms. Davis.
Claire : Mm.

Haley : Uh, yeah. No, there's just, like, a lot on my mind with graduation, and
what to wear. How does this look?
Phil : Wait a second. You're carrying your shoes. How am I supposed to judge
the whole outfit? Put 'em on.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Maxine : For 30 years, I've been hearing it's a handball injury. But it always
seems to get worse with stress. Maybe it's that audit he's got coming up.
Gloria : Audit?

Jay : So make sure you give this menu here a good, thorough reading.

Jay : It's nothing.

Gloria : Soup.

Maxine : Oh, isn't that cute? He doesn't want you to worry. Here's your
sandwich. Now you should worry.

Jay : You didn't even look at it.
Gloria : Soup.
Jay : Check out what's below the soup... Sandwiches.
Gloria : Have you check out what is below this outfit? This doesn't come from
sandwiches.
Jay : Look!
Gloria : "The Jay Pritchett"? I don't understand. They named you after a
sandwich?
Jay : No! They named a sandwich after me!
Gloria : "Turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, red peppers, anchovies on wheat"?
Jay : Most people would stop after the salty bacon, but I double down with the
anchovies.
Gloria : Were you making a sandwich or attracting deer?
Maxine : Is this bum bothering you, miss?
Jay : Oh, I should get a picture of this... an actual waitress sighting in this
dump.
Maxine : I took a chance and put in an order for your sandwich, although
most people like their Jay Pritchetts to go.
Gloria : What's happening?
Jay : Gloria, it's Maxine.
Maxine : So you're married to Jay. Where'd you tie up your seeing eye dog?
Gloria : No, no, I'm not, um... Okay, I get it. I get it.
Maxine : Here's that number for that neck doctor I want you to see.
Jay : Thanks.
Gloria : What's wrong with your neck?

Jay : Look at it... my prettiest child.
Gloria : Why didn't you tell me about your neck?
Jay : It's fine. Take a bite.
Gloria : Your company's getting audited?
Jay : Nothing! Three bad days, then it's over. Come on! I'm... I'm anxious to
hear what you think. I see it growing on ya. It's like Maxine when she first
tried it. You know, she...
Gloria : I don't like it.
Jay : You probably didn't get all...
Gloria : Jay, I try it. I don't like it.
Jay : That's all you can say?
Gloria : It tastes bad in my mouth. It's like a fish and a Turkey beat themselves
to death with a pepper.
Jay : Okay, fair enough. Maybe a little picky, though, from someone who
prepared a Colombian specialty and said, "why are you not eating the hooves?
They're the best part."
Cameron : I'm back!
Haley : Oh, hey, Uncle Cam.
Cameron : Oh, thanks again for picking me up last night. You're welcome, but
you have to be more careful.
Haley : I was the responsible one. Lisa was drinking, and I took her keys, and
then e...
Cameron : I understand. My senior year, I had a pretty crazy night myself
involving a bottle of corn mash and an overturned plow.
Haley : Seriously?
Modern Family Season 3x23 page.2

Cameron : Yeah. You don't know terror until you've had to stare down the
eyes of a Missouri State Trooper and talk your way out of a P.U.I.

Cameron : But do you see how she's slowly transitioning from the lights to the
music?

Claire : Honey, you don't drink coffee.

Claire : Yeah. Yeah, I do. It's hard to believe there was ever a time when we
just said, "stop doing that." Oh. The garbage disposal. Lily, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Now let's redirect you into a nap, huh?

Alex : I do when I've been up half the night worrying about a project that's
only one-third done, and I still have an apron to sew, scenery to paint, plus my
normal crushing workload. So... Unless you have a better way for me to
stimula... Oh, God. God, coffee's bitter.

Cameron : Actually, we're doing this new thing where we let her tell us when
she wants to take a nap.
Claire : Uh-huh.

Claire : That was your first sip?

Cameron : It's called "being your own nap Captain." Come on, sweetie.

Cameron : Okay, I got the chafing dish, salt and pepper shakers... perfect
matches, both. I may have to readjust my grapes.

Phil : Hey! Hey.

Claire : Oh. Ow. I'll just give you a little privacy. Welcome back to the light
show. Hi.
Cameron : Hi, Lily.
Lily : Hi, daddy.
Claire : Lily... Sweetheart, no. No, no, no, no. We're... we're not gonna do that
today.
Cameron : Actually... actually, Claire, we're... we're trying not to use the word
"no" so much. We just read a book that said children learn to rebel against that
word.
Claire : Uh-huh.
Cameron : So we redirect her into a new activity instead. Oh. Here... well, just
watch this. Lily, sweetie, hi. It's daddy here. Would you like to listen to some
music? Okay. There you go. See?
Claire : Every new generation thinks they have cracked the code on child
rearing. What's the latest theory? Never say "no." I say "no" every day in this
house.
Phil : But at night, she's a "yes" machine.
Claire : No.
Claire : Oh, it doesn't seem that she is redirecting her own energy as much as
using a lot of ours.

Mitchell : Phil. Hey. Did you ring the doorbell?
Phil : Oh, no, 'cause I have these two coffees. One is for you.
Mitchell : Thank you.
Mitchell : Here's my life... a full-time job, a 3-year-old, and a second one on the
way. And as a favor, I agreed to do a little work for Phil's agency. The problem
is, I'm very good, and the more I do, the more they want me. I-I even turned in
a few assignments late so that they'd fall out of love with me a little bit.
Mitchell : Right. How... how long have you been standing here? Are... are
you... are you all right?
Phi : Oh, yeah.
Mitchell : 'Cause you're... you're really blinking.
Phil : I'm a stress blinker, um, and what really gets me going is confrontation. I
hate it. I-I avoid it at all costs. Terrible at it. Once, I, uh, I tried to break up with
a girl, and I danced around it so much, she didn't know I had broken up with
her. 20 years later, we're still married.
Phil : I am... really... sorry... About the cold coffee.
Mitchell : It's not that cold. It's lukewarm, so...
Modern Family Season 3x23 page.3

Phil : Funny story about that expression... when the kids were younger, um,
we had a, uh, a wading pool... And occasionally, Luke would have an accident,
and, um, Alex would scream, and we'd say, um, "it's okay, honey, he's just
making it lukewarm." Wow, so...
Mitchell : So I gotta get going, but I-I'll see...
Phil : Okay, wait! I'm just gonna come straight out and say it. Mitchell, you've
done a wonderful job for the agency since you decided you'd help us out for
just a little bit. And we couldn't ask for more, could we? I wish it didn't have
to end. In fact, if it was up to me, you'd stay on forever...

Gloria : You were very quiet all the way home. Are you upset at me because I
honked at that old lady?
Jay : Normally, we leave the honking to the driver, but I'm used to it.
Gloria : Is it because of the sandwich?
Jay : Ah, you maybe could have eaten half of it... Said a couple of nice things.
Gloria : It's just a sandwich, Jay.

Mitchell : Phil, Phil...

Jay : It's not about the delicious sandwich, Gloria. It's about being respectful of
a person's feelings.

Phil : But it is not just up to me, is it? So... I...

Gloria : But I was just being honest.

Mitchell : Phil, I saw this coming, and... and look...

Jay : You don't have to be honest about every little thing in a relationship.
Some things you say, some things you don't.

Mitchell : I bailed. I made an excuse and left. But I-I-I've gotta be straight with
him. "Phil, I cannot stay on with your firm forever." Oh! God, it's gonna crush
him. Maybe I can get Claire to do it.
Phil : Well, that was easy!
Professor : We're really proud of you, buddy. See you at the ceremony.
Manny : You're not a hero.
Luke : I put out a fire.
Manny : A fire you started.
Luke : Was there a fire?
Manny : Yes.
Luke : Did I put it out?
Manny : That's not...
Luke : Answer the question.
Manny : Yes.
Luke : I'm getting an award for it. If they gave awards for starting fires, I'd be
getting one of those, too.
Manny : I know you have a conscience, Luke. Do you see this flag? It stands
for Justice. So when that fire marshall gets here, I know you're going to look at
that flag and do the right thing.

Gloria : Oh? What are the things that you don't say?
Jay : Gloria, I really don't wanna do this anymore.
Gloria : Oh, really? But you cannot just try to teach me a lesson, and then not
even...
Jay : Okay, fine. I don't say this, but it... bothers me a little bit that you're just a
tiny bit... loud.
Gloria : Loud?
Jay : Not all the time. Only when you, you know, when you talk.
Gloria : So I embarrass you?
Jay : Gloria...
Gloria : What? Am I being too loud again?
Jay : All right. Buckle up.
Gloria : Oh, I'm gonna go and try to do the laundry, and I'm gonna do it very
quietly so I don't bother you. Maybe Manny can help me. Manny!
Jay : I get it.
Gloria : Manny!
Jay : I get it. Now you're not even making any noise.

Modern Family Season 3x23 page.4

Alex : Okay, this is way too many grapes, and this spoon is modern day, so if
we use it, everyone at the table has to react in shock at the spoon from the
future. Okay.

Phil : It's living art. We stay perfectly still for 90 seconds, basically doing
nothing.

Claire : And that went down the drain.

Matt : I don't know. She always moved for me.

Alex : And you need a nap.
Lily : You need a nap.

Phil : As long as you both agree it was only 90 seconds. Two nerds with one
stone! I love working in an office.

Cameron : I got it. Ooh, I lost it. Shoot.

Matt : Is that your brother-in-law? I thought you fired him.

Claire : Let me know if I can eliminate any distractions for you.

Phil : I did, before work.

Cameron : Oh, I got it. No, I got a finger on it. There it is. Oh, lost it again.

Skip : Then what's he doing here?

Claire : Maybe you should just wait until it comes to you. You know, make it
the Captain of its own spoon platoon.

Matt : Is he disgruntled? He looks disgruntled.

Cameron : I understand the point you're making, Claire, but... Oh! Now I'm
stuck.

Mitchell : Hey, hey. Listen... Okay, I know this is uncomfortable... but we really
need to talk about my future here.

Claire : Yeah, Cam, you are stuck. You are stuck on a philosophy that clearly
doesn't work. Sometimes, you need to say "no" to a child.

Phil : But I-I-I thought we...

Cameron : Yeah, and sometimes you need to say "no" to an adult. No, Claire.
No, I don't need help raising my child.
Claire : Oh. Okay. Sorry. Guess I-I do have a lot to learn. Right now, I-I'm
looking forward to learning if you will get your arm out of there before Lily
gets to the garbage disposal switch.

Skip : Sounds like my first wife.

Phil : No, he always looks like that. Hey. How's it going?

Mitchell : No, I know. I know I led you to believe that I'd be able to stay on
here indefinitely, and... and... O-okay, don't get all blinky.
Phil : Oh.
Mitchell : No, it's not all bad news, okay?
Phil : Okay.

Cameron : Um... Lily, sweetie! C-can you do something, please, Claire?

Mitchell : You will have me until July, like we agreed.

Claire : I would like to. Really, I would, but I would probably just say "no" and
shred her confidence and mangle her self-esteem.

Phil : Okay, great.

Cameron : Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Just... here. Stop her! Stop her! Sweetie!

Phil : Hey, could you jump on the elevator with me real quick? Yes. Yes. I
could use a hand carrying up some stuff from my car. Oh! My goodness. I
probably need some empty boxes, don't I? You know what? You head down,
I'll meet you at the glass doors. There was something else. What was it? I
know it's in there. Oh, yeah, you're fired.

Claire : What to do with you?
Cameron : Claire! Okay!
Claire : Ohh! Yes!
Cameron : You think that's funny, don't ya?
Claire : Yes!
Cameron : Yes. Well, it's wicked, Claire. It's wicked. Come on. We're leaving,
Lily! Lily!

Mitchell : Yes.

Mitchell : What? F-fired?! W-what's going on with these things? You trying to
open 'em?
Phil : Mm-hmm. I guess I better... get somebody.
Mitchell : Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... you're firing me? I-I don't even
like this job.
Modern Family Season 3x23 page.5

Phil : That can't be safe.
Realtor #1 : Is someone trapped in there?

Luke : Yep. And thanks to you, I had them move the ceremony to right under
the flag. I'll sign a picture for you.

Realtor #2 : The guy they fired.

Alex : Oh, there you are. I was afraid you weren't coming.

Realtor #1 : Oh, the lazy guy?

Cameron : It was a discussion.

Mitchell : Lazy?!

Mitchell : If we weren't gonna show up, we would have clearly let you know,
and not humiliated you in public.

Phil : You handed in a couple of things late. I should have warned you. I'm
terrible at breaking bad news.
Mitchell : Well, then why did you come over to my house and tell me how
great I was?

Phil : If it's any consolation, the lawyer we hired to replace you is already
suing the elevator company.
Haley : Ow. You're sitting on my hand.

Phil : That was me trying to fire you! I haven't felt like this since I tried to
break up with Claire 20 years ago.

Cameron : Be thankful you have two. I almost lost one today.

Realtor #3 : Someone's stuck again?

Alex : Shh! Keep your voices down. We're about to go on.

Realtor #1 : That lawyer with the attitude they just fired.
Phil : They said it was your attitude, like you were doing us a favor.

Gloria : Why you looking at me? Am I too loud? Is that what everybody
thinks?

Mitchell : I was doing you a favor!

Alex : What?

Realtor #3 : Why didn't he get the stairs like everyone else?

Jay : There's a backstory here you don't wanna know about.

Realtor #2 : Lazy.

Lily : I want turkey.

Phil : Don't worry, he can't get you.

Jay : Save your appetite, baby girl. And don't forget, afterwards, we're going to
Lenny's for a bite to eat... more than a bite if you value my feelings.

Mitchell : Two hours I got stuck in there with an entire office of people staring
at me. I finally had to lie down. Didn't help my reputation.

Claire : Oh, stop being such a baby. She was nowhere near that switch.

Claire : Oh! Great, we get to see Maxine.
Gloria : What? You know Maxine, too?
Mitchell : Oh, we all know Maxine. Love.

Realtor #2 : Figures.
Phil : You guys nailed it. Dude, that was surreal. Get it?
Alex : Dad, come on! We have a minute to set up! Where are Mitchell and
Cam?

Phil : Second-best hugger in the world, after Mr. Burt Reynolds. Story to
follow.
Alex : All right, guys, this will all be over in 90 seconds. Hold your poses.
Cameron : Okay.
Alex : I really wanna impress Mr. Gorgeous. Jarvis! Shut up.

Luke : Hey, Manny. Thanks for what you said before about the flag. It really
got me thinking.

Phil : Hey, Mitch, I know this isn't a good time, I-I just want you to know, I'm
really...

Manny : I knew you had a conscience, Luke. And more importantly, you've
got a good... You didn't.

Mitchell : I know, Phil. You're really sorry, okay? But this is gonna take me a
little time to get over, all right?
Phil : Actually, I was gonna say I'm really gonna need your parking pass.
Modern Family Season 3x23 page.6

Mitchell : What?!

Phil : I didn't dumpped her! I just tried to!

Woman : Our next stage presentation will be Alex Dunphy's interpretation of
Norman Rockwell's 1943 painting "Freedom from want."

Gloria : I am losing it!

Manny : How do you sleep at night, Luke?

Lily : I want turkey.

Luke : With a medal around my neck.

All : Lily, no!

Alex : Shh!

Cameron : We really are trying to not say that word.

Lily : I want Turkey.

Alex : B-minus, but there was a silver lining. "I expected more, Alex." Alex!

Alex : Lily, no!

Claire : I am gonna call Haley and tell her we're not going to that deli. I can't
take another minute of Cam.

Claire : She doesn't understand that word.

Alex : Just a few more seconds!

Cameron : Cram it, Claire.
Claire : Control your child, Cam. It's not that difficult. I've raised three.
Cameron : Really?

Cameron : You know, I'm not even sure I believe all these new parenting
theories, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna let her tell me they're wrong.

Alex : Cam!

Mitchell : We are not going to dinner.

Cameron : Why don't you ask Haley what time she got home last night?
Haley : Uncle Cam!

Gloria : I tried that sandwich. It's not that good. You're not missing anything.

Cameron : Sorry, dear. Collateral damage.

Manny : I sure won't miss seeing Luke and that stupid medal. I play by the
rules. Where's my medal?

Claire : What is he talking about?
Alex : Shh!
Jay : Your arms are shaking.
Gloria : Oh, yeah, I'm sure that the great Maxine can do a better job!
Claire : You can criticize my parenting all you like, Cam, but my son just won
a medal.
Manny : For a fire he started.
Claire ! Luke, is that true?
Gloria : How long? It's getting heavy!
Mitchell : You're not getting that parking pass back.
Phil : I tried to let you down easy.
Mitchell : You don't know how to talk to people, Phil. It's just like when Claire
didn't even know you dumped her.
Claire : What?
Haley : When did dad dump you?

Gloria : Jay can stay with that Maxine. She's not loud like me.
Phil : In fairness, you can be a little quick to give advice.
Claire : Well, I'm always ready to help, if that's what you mean, yeah.
Phil : Yeah, but if you're not careful, it can come off a little... Know-it-all-y.
Claire : That's not a word. What you mean to say is, it can come off like I know
it all. I've always been this way.
Phil : That's why I wanted to break up with you.
Mitchell : The word "fired" doesn't even apply. You can't get fired from a favor.
Cameron : Okay, sweetie, maybe you should just let it go. Like I always say,
it's better to carry a tune than a grudge.
Mitchell : Okay, you... You've never said that, but... And... and what about this
grudge you're holding against Claire? I don't see you trading that in for a tune.
Modern Family Season 3x23 page.7

Cameron : That is completely different. She insulted my parenting skills.

Phil : I just really need one of these. Hey. Don't hold back.

Mitchell : Which, you have to admit, you can be pretty defensive about.

Maxine : Oh!

Cameron : Okay, so maybe we both can be a little sensitive.

Jay : My girls. There they are.

Mitchell : N-no. No. Mnh-mnh. No. These... these are... these are not equal.
No, you have no idea what it feels like to be fired.

Jay : Hey, Cam. Come on in!

Cameron : Yes, I do. I've been fired. Everyone has.

Mitchell : Yeah.

Mitchell : Not me.

Jay : There she is.

Cameron : Never?

Maxine : Well, look who made it.

Mitchell : No. Nope, I've always been very good at what I do.

Gloria : Hola, Maxine. So nice to see you.

Cameron : So then maybe what you're feeling is a little insecure about your
work for the first time.

Maxine : Let me get you some menus.

Mitchell : That's hogwash.
Cameron : As someone who's seen actual hogwash, I can assure you that it's
not.
Manny : I don't know why you're so bothered by Maxine. She's nice.
Gloria : Oh, good! Why don't you, Jay, and Maxine live together, eating
sandwiches forever?!
Manny : Can I float a theory here, mom? You sound like you're jealous.
Gloria : Please! Me jealous of that woman? I just don't like the way they talk to
each other! And the little jokes, and she knows everything about his life! Just
makes me feel like, em... Is that jealous? Ay, my poor sisters.

Phil : I, uh, I appreciate your coming. And, again, I really, really... thank you.

Gloria : We don't need it. It's Jay Pritchetts all around!
Jay : Gloria, if you want your sandwich without anchovies, I won't be
offended.
Gloria : Aw. Of course, then it'll be a Jack Feldman.
Phil : Hey.
Mitchell : Hmm?
Phil : Hey, man.
Mitchell : Is the repair guy here?
Phil : He's working on it. Um, listen, uh, it's Katie's birthday, skip's assistant.
Big 3-0. Still no ring.

Maxine : Just you? I thought the whole family was swinging by.

Mitchell : You woke me up to tell me that?

Jay : Who knows what they're doing? Right now, they're all sniping at each
other.

Phil : No, no. I-I grabbed you some cake.

Maxine : Ah, who needs 'em?

Phil : Okay. Had that coming.

Jay : Right. As long as I have you, Maxine...

Realtor #2 : Who are you talking to, Phil?

Maxine : I'm off in five. Hey, Luke! What's with all the hardware?

Phil : Mitchell.

Claire : Well, he set fire to a school and lied about it.

Realtor #2 : Who?

Jay : You know they give medals for anything these days.

Phil : Mitchell, my br... uh, the lazy guy.

Claire : It's going back tomorrow. He doesn't get a lot of medals.

Mitchell : I was doing you a favor. All right, just give me the cake. I'm hungry.
No! Oh.

Mitchell : Oh, sure it's not for employees only?

Modern Family Season 3x23 page.8

3x24 : Baby On Board

Mitchell : Yeah, l...
Cameron : We have to do this.

Cameron : One, two, three, four. And skip, two, three, four. And turn, two,
three, four.
Lily : I don't like this part.

Mitchell : Okay, okay. Yeah, you're right um, all right, I'm gonna go dig up the
old car seat. And listen, let's just... Take a deep breath before we tell anyone,
okay?

Cameron : Well, honey, if you spot the wall, then you won't get dizzy. Here,
watch daddy, okay?

Cameron : Yeah.

Mitchell : How cool would it be if you turned into wonder woman right now?
Cameron : Can't even talk about it.

Gloria : Jay! Manny! Good news! Mitch and Cam are getting a new baby
today!

Mitchell : Oh, it's the adoption agency.

Jay : Really? That's fantastic.

Cameron : Oh, my gosh. It is?! It is?! It is?!

Gloria : And it's Latino!

Mitchell : Cam, you need to stop doing that. Last time, they were just calling
to confirm our billing address. Hello? Uh-huh.

Jay : How's that giant fence working out for ya?
Gloria : It's Claire. Hello? Did you hear?

Cameron : "Uh-huh" what?
Mitchell : Yep. Really?

Mitchell : Hey, Claire.

Cameron : "Really" what?
Mitchell : That... that mother from Calexico, she picked us.

Claire : You are driving to some California border town to adopt a baby, and I
have to hear about it from Gloria?

Cameron : She did?

Mitchell : I was outside for two minutes.

Mitchell : Uh-huh. She... she went into early labor. She's having the baby
today.

Cameron : I kept it in as long as I could. We're having a baby!

Cameron : She is?!

[OPENING CREDITS]

Mitchell : Uh-huh. We have to go to Calexico right now.
Cameron : We do?!

Phil : Oh, ho ho ho!

Mitchell : Just assume everything I say is the truth.

Luke : What the heck is that?

Cameron : Okay, yeah.

Phil : What?!

Mitchell : Okay. Oh, okay, yes. Well, thank you so much. Okay, bye. Um...
we're getting a baby today.

Claire : We're back. We got Alex the cutest prom dress. Show your dad.

Cameron : Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Ohh!

Phil : Hey. Well, I don't like how far down that zipper goes, but on the plus
side, it looks water-resistant.

Mitchell : Wait, wait, wait. What do we do about Lily's recital?

Luke : I can't believe Haley's not going to the prom and Alex is.

Cameron : Um... well, you know what? We'll... we'll just sit her down. We'll...
we'll tell her. We'll... We'll give her a popsicle. She'll be fine.

Alex : What's that supposed to mean?

Modern Family Season 3x24 page.1

Phil : I know I keep saying it, Haley, but you should be going. It's a major
moment in a teenager's life, and you're missing it.

Jay : That's charcuterie? I've been avoiding that on menus for years. They're
killing themselves with that name.

Haley : Proms are lame. It's just an excuse for dressed up dorks to ride in limos
and hump each other.

Gloria : They're here! They're here!

Phil : Okay. Now I don't like the idea of Alex going.

Gloria : Of course.

Claire : Sweetie, I think we're fine. It's... it's Alex.
Alex : What's that supposed to mean?

Cameron : Okay, so her recital's at 6:00. That's the address. Here's her outfit.
This is our camcorder. Get the whole show and some backstage color.

Luke : It means you're a geek.

Manny : Guys, you wanna take our charcuterie for the road?

Alex : You know what? You know what? I might just go crazy tonight and...
and... and hook up all over him.

Jay : Bup, bup, bup, bup. They're good. We may need that.

Mitchell : Hi! Thank you so much for doing this. Thank you. Thank you.

Claire : Mm-hmm. Okay.

Mitchell : Hello? Yeah, um... H-hold on one second, I think it's the baby's
family. They're speaking Spanish. I...

Alex : Why are you laughing? That's not funny. I'm not even gonna wear my
glasses!

Cameron : Hola, soy Cameron. ¿Cómo está? Uh, b... Excuse me. Could you s...
Could you slow down just a little bit? What does frenético mean?

Claire : Oh.

Gloria : It's when...

Phil : I feel better now.

Mitchell : Or just let her do it. Yeah. There you go.

Claire : Mm.

Gloria : Okay. Hello? Sí, sí. Yo los puedo ayudar...

Haley : All right, I'm going to the mall.

Cameron : I was doing fine.

Claire : Um, we need to talk, honey. We're worried about you. You haven't
heard back from the college that wait-listed you, and all the rest of your
friends have. And now you're just wasting time at the mall.

Mitchell : He thinks he's some sort of an expert because for the past two
weeks, he's been watching this ridiculous Spanish soap opera.

Haley : For your information, I've already filled out and dropped off my
community college application. And plus also I'm going to the mall because I
have a job interview.
Phil : What?
Claire : Really?
Haley : My guidance counselor suggested I take a gap year. You know, a year
between high school and college were you take some courses, have some life
experiences, and get inspired. And obviously, work at the GAP.
Jay : The first step in plane building... Organize the parts. You got your power
plant. You got your fuselage. You got your control surfaces. What's that?
Manny : A charcuterie. You got your prosciutto, your pancetta, your salami.

Jay : "Fire And Ice"? Don't say a word about the ending of last night's episode.
G-Gloria watches that. You'll ruin it.
Gloria : Sí. Van a estar esperando su llamada, muchísimas gracias. It was the
mother's sister Juanita. She said that she doesn't know the exact hospital yet,
but that she will call you, like, in the next hour.
Mitchell : Oh, thank you, Gloria. I-I hate to ask this of you, but would you
mind coming with us? We need someone who actually knows how to speak
Spanish.
Cameron : Frío. Muy frío.
Gloria : Ay, yes, of course! I would love to! Thank you! Thank you! I'm gonna
grab my stuff, and we go, okay?
Mitchell : All right, sweetheart. All right, come here. Daddies gotta go, okay?
All right.
Modern Family Season 3x24 page.2

Cameron : Okay, we're so sorry we're missing your recital, sweetie. But you
know what? You're getting a brand-new baby brother!

Lily : Watch me dance.

Mitchell : Cam, come on. Come on.

Jay : Honey, you don't need to practice anymore. The turning, the jumping, the
little bird thing... You've got it.

Cameron : Mwah! Okay. All right, breathe, breathe, breathe.

Lily : What's this?

Gloria : Ciao, Jay! Ciao, Manny! I see you later, okay?
Jay : What just happened here?

Jay : Sweetie, please don't play with the pieces. I've told you, they're very
delicate.

Lily : I have to go to the bathroom.

Lily : What are you building?

Manny : She's talking to you.

Manny : It's a model of a plane that was built for Amelia Earhart.

Jay : You wanna take that?

Lily : Why?
Jay : Because she wanted to fly around the world.

Phil : Always keep the rhythm in your feet. Then we're gonna add just a little
party in the shoulders. All right? Now let's get those arms going. No, no, no.
Arms down here says, "I'm white and I'm sorry," but arms up here says, "You
don't know what I am."
Alex : I-I don't.
Haley : You're never gonna believe it! You're never gonna believe it! You're
never gonna believe it! Guess who got a job! I did! Oh, shoot. I just told you.
Claire : Oh! Honey, congratulations!
Phil : That's amazing!
Claire : You got a job! And what is all this?
Haley : I stopped by the grocery store to get some stuff for dinner.
Claire : You know where the grocery store is?
Haley : Yes, mother. I'm celebrating by making dinner for me and Dylan
tonight. Would you and dad like to join us?
Claire : What's happening?
Phil : I don't know.
Haley : Tonight at dinner, I'm telling my parents the biggest news of all. After
graduation, I'm moving in with someone.
Dylan : And his name is me.

Lily : Why?
Jay : Because she problem needed to get away from her kids.
Lily : Why?
Jay : You know how to stop this?
Manny : I'm on it. Lily, we really need you to let us concentrate for a few
minutes, okay?
Lily : Your hair is weird.
Manny : Um, now I'm flustered.
Claire : Oh, you look adorable!
Alex : "Adorable"? I'm not a puppy.
Claire : Oh, honey, it was meant as a compliment.
Phil : Claire, I got this. Honey, you look super sexy.
Alex : Ew.
Phil : Well, we tried everything.
Alex : Oh, good-bye!
Phil : Wait! Wait, wait! We wanna meet this Casanova.
Alex : Oh, no, parents aren't really his scene.
Claire : Alex, open the door. We are going to get a picture.
Alex : Fine.
Michael : You... look... flawless.
Modern Family Season 3x24 page.3

Alex : Thanks.

Cameron : Don't listen to him.

Michael : Did I not say coral was the color for you? Look what it does for your
skin. Hi!
Phil : Hi, buddy.

Gloria : Nothing, really. Antonio hired a hooker to marry his father so that he
can get back the money, but the hooker ended up being his long lost sister, the
former beauty queen.

Claire : Hi.

Mitchell : Oh. Well, I stand uncorrected.
Gloria : Ay, please just drive straighter.

Alex : Yes, my bad boy prom date is gay. He just doesn't know it yet, so I'm
basically his beard. Pre-beard. His stubble.

Cameron : Oh, sorry. Are my pinkies up again? I... They do that when I get
excited. Down, girls!

Phil : Okay, say "cheese"!

Phil : Well, Alex should be hitting the dance floor right about now. Must be
fun.

Alex : Cheese.
Phil : Okay, now one with flash.

Haley : Really, dad, let it go.

Alex : Okay, I think you got the picture.

Phil : I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm just sad you're missing it. I can still totally picture
my prom night. My date was Angela Wilkins. My dad dressed as a limo driver
and spoke with a British accent. He even announced our arrival. "Sir Philliam
Dunphy and the Lady Wilkins!"

Phil : Well, you guys have fun.

Claire : Ahem.

Claire : Do you want me to touch up your hair, honey?

Phil : All the cool kids were totally laughing with us.

Michael : Oh, no, I'm good.

Claire : Oh, I'm just so glad we met after that.

Alex : Cheese.
Michael : Cheese!

Phil : Oh. Me, too. Wonder what ever happened to Angela?
Gloria : Ay, please stop driving the car like a snake. It's making me nauseating.

Dylan : You don't know?

Mitchell : Well, uh, if you want to switch places, there's plenty of room to
stretch out back here.

Phil : I haven't seen her in over 20 years, but that's what's special about prom.
No matter what... The Lady Wilkins and I will always have that night.

Cameron : Yeah, that's why we traded our old prius in for the new one. You
know, bigger family, bigger backseat. You can fit two car seats and a prizewinning pig back there.

Dylan : Wow. Hmm.

Mitchell : Please don't put a pig in the backseat with our children.
Cameron : I'm not being literal. It's a unit of measurement we used on the
farm. You know, like, "that bed's a double-pigger." Oh, uh, sorry. Maybe think
about something else. You know, I missed "Fire And Ice" on Monday. What
happened?
Mitchell : My guess is a bunch of ridiculous plot turns done by overwrought
actors who are impossibly good-looking.

Haley : Oh, no, no, no! We got this. We'll clean.
Phil : Oh. Uh...
Claire : Oh. You're cleaning up? What kind of day is this? Cam and Mitch get a
new son, we get a new daughter.
Phil : That was really fun, you guys.
Dylan : Yeah, and next time, we'll just do it at our place.
Luke : I'm in. Just give me a heads-up.
Claire : "Our place"?
Modern Family Season 3x24 page.4

Haley : Um, well, since I have a job now and I'm going to community college,
uh, Dylan and I were thinking that, you know, we would get an apartment
together.
Claire : What?
Luke : Are you doing sex?
Phil : Luke, can we have a minute, please?
Claire : Um...
Dylan : Listen... I know that you're concerned, but I'm designing t-shirts now,
and they're gonna be huge. Also medium and small.
Claire : Dylan, would you excuse us for a moment so we can talk to Haley?
Dylan : Sure, but you stay. I'll go.
Mitchell : Hi. Uh, uh, buenos noches. Uh, uh, we're looking for... Uh, English?
Uh, well, Juanita. We're looking for Juanita.

Juanita : Padre. ¿qué hace usted acá?
Padre : Ven acá. Vengo con un serio aviso, mi niña.
Juanita : Perdone.
Mitchell : Gloria, what's going on?
Gloria : I don't know. The priest comes with great warning.
Cameron : That can't be good.
Gloria : Shh! Something about the grandmother. She's sick.
Cameron : Ohh.
Gloria : But now she's better.
Mitchell : Oh.
Gloria : And now she knows!
Mitchell : Knows what?
Juanita : Tú. Tú hiciste esto. Tú le dijiste a mi abuela acerca del bebé.

Juanita : ¡Hola!

Nurse : ¿Por qué haría yo tal cosa?

Mitchell : Hi.

Juanita : Porque Carlos me escogió a mí... en vez de a ti como su amante.

Juanita : Mitchelly Cameron?

Mitchell : What was that for?!

Gloria : Ah, she says, "Hello, Mitch and Cameron."

Cameron : The nurse stole her grandmother's almonds.

Cameron : I think we got that.

Gloria : No, the nurse is mad at Juanita because Juanita stole her lover, and
Juanita is mad at the nurse because the nurse told the grandmother about the
baby!

Gloria : Ay, you brought me here.
Juanita : El bebé nació hace media hora y se encuentra perfectamente de salud.
Siete libras con cuatro onzas. Es hermoso, tiene el pelo grueso y los ojos
grandes y cafecitos.

Cameron : Our baby?
Mitchell : Our baby?

Gloria : Ay, ¡qué bueno! Did you get that, too?
Cameron : Yeah, a lot of it. Mm-hmm.
Mitchell : Just... Just tell us.
Gloria : The baby was born half-hour ago, that he's in perfect health. He was 7
pounds, 4 ounces, with thick hair and brown eyes.
Mitchell : That's so good!
Cameron : So good.
Padre : Juanita!

Manny : We're both thinking it. I'm just gonna say it. Lily's dance is not up to
the standard of what we just saw.
Jay : In my head, I'm golfing right now.
Dance Teacher : Hi, Mr. Pritchett? I'm Lily's dance teacher Lucy. We have a
little bit of an issue. Lily doesn't want to perform.
Jay : Oh, the poor thing. You get the kid, I'll get the car.
Dance Teacher : Oh, no. It's really important for Lily's self-esteem that she go
on. I think one of you should talk to her.
Modern Family Season 3x24 page.5

Manny : You know she stinks, right?
Dance Teacher : And I think it should be you.
Jay : Lily. Your teacher tells me you don't want to dance. Is that true? But you
were so good back at the house when you were practicing.

gonna take its toll on that body and that face, think again. Good-bye, beautiful
skin. Farewell, silky hair. And hello, Alex's hand-me-downs, 'cause you can't
afford to shop.
Phil : Good one.
Claire : Mm-hmm.

Lily : I wanna go home, to my house!
Jay : Ah, to your house, huh? Are you sad your dads aren't here? Yeah. Well, I
know they're sad to miss this, but they're getting you that baby brother. That's
good, right? You know, honey, your dads are gonna love you just as much
when you get this brother. Trust me. I first had your aunt Claire, and then your
dad came along, and I loved them just the same, no matter what he tells you.
You believe me? Close enough. So what do you say? You gonna go out there
and dance for everybody?
Lily : No.
Jay : Honey, there must be something I can do to get you out there.
Lily : Come dance with me, grandpa.

Dylan : Do you think that this is gonna work out?
Luke : Yes. Well, for my parents, I mean. For you? No.
Dylan : God. I just wanna live with Haley so bad. It's like, I missed all this
time with her in Wyoming. Then I thought I was gonna lose her again to
college.
Luke : Don't worry. I got your back, buddy. That's not gonna happen.
Dylan : What does that mean?
Luke : Dylan, shut the door. The bedroom door.

Jay : No, honey, that's not gonna happen. How about I give you 50 bucks?

Cameron : Excuse me. Excuse me. Okay. We're very confused. Can somebody
please just tell us what's happening?

Haley : I don't see why I can't do this. I'm totally getting my life together.

Gloria : Somebody told the grandmother about the baby, and she wasn't
supposed to know. If you ask me, it was the sexy priest.

Claire : Uh, allow me, if you will, to paint an accurate picture of this life you
think you want, okay?

Eduardo : Enough! It wasn't the priest. It was me.

Phil : Yeah.
Claire : Um, at first, it's a blast, buying a dish rack, hanging a sheet up to turn
one room into two.

Nurse : Eduardo! Oh!
Juanita : Ay! Ay!
Mitchell : Oh! What's happening?

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Eduardo : Yes, I am alive. And I may be just a ranch hand, but I'm the one that
told your abuela about the baby. I told her because I swore to your mother to
look after your family. Your mother... Was my lover.

Phil : Because you couldn't afford the Sklurg.

Juanita : ¿qué?

Claire : But then... Then those bills start rollingin... So you gotta pick up some
extra shifts. Yeah. And suddenly... Uh-oh, what's that? You're pregnant.

Gloria : Ay, wait a minute. Now I go from English to Spanish. Que él no está
muerto...

Phil : Should've been safe.

Mitchell : C-can we please just see our baby?

Claire : Ooh, and you're stressed and exhausted. You've got a garage filled
with unsold huge t-shirts. And, honey, if you think this kind of stress is not

Abuela : No!

Phil : Allen-wrenching a bookcase called a Nurnk...

All : ¿Abuela?
Modern Family Season 3x24 page.6

Abuela : ¿Cómo te atreves a ocultar esto de mí? El bebé es mi familia, y no va
a ser educado por extraños.

Dylan : Could you do one thing for me, though? Could you take me to your
prom?

Gloria : She's saying that she's going to raise the baby.

Phil : Really?

Cameron : No.

Dylan : Yeah. I mean, if you go off to college and you don't come back here, I
want you to remember me. I wanna be your Angela Wilkins.

Mitchell : Cam.

Claire : Oh.
Phil : Guess what? Suddenly, you're 60 years old, wandering toothless and
alone in a postapocalyptic wasteland.

Haley : Mom?

Haley : Wait a second. How did Dylan get the nuclear codes again?

Haley : Can I borrow that purple dress I said you were too old for?

Phil : During the robot wars.

Claire : Mm, in spite of that, yeah. Yeah.

Claire : Okay, I think your father might have gotten a little bit off-track here.
Honey, listen, the point is, the choices you make today...

Phil : Hey, buddy.

Haley : No, no, the point is, is that it doesn't have to turn out so bad.

Phil : Yeah, sure. I mean, it's the tux I got married in, so it's double-breasted.

Dylan : She's right. It doesn't. Luke?

Dylan : Perfect. So am I.

Luke : This came yesterday.

Phil : Okay.

Claire : Yes.

Dylan : Mr. D. Do you have a tuxedo I could borrow?

Claire : What is it?
Dylan : It's from that college. You got in, Haley.

Gloria : I'm going to get something for my stomach.

Claire : Oh, d... Oh, my God.P You got into college?
Claire : Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Aah!

Cameron : Oh, come on, swipe. Swipe! M-Mitchell, I need your help. It won't
swipe, and I'm in no condition to "see cashier." Mitchell. Mitchell. Mitchell?
Mitch--Mitchell! Where are you going?!

Phil : That's amazing!

Mitchell : I'm just sick of it, Cam.

Claire : It came yest... Yesterday? Luke, why were you hiding this?

Cameron : Mitchell. Mitchell, come back here and talk to me. There are coyotes
out here and... and meth addicts!

Phil : What?!

Luke : I don't know.

Haley : Aw! You're gonna miss me!

Mitchell : Every time, Cam. Every time someone says that we're getting a-a
baby, I get my hopes up and then... And then when it all falls apart, I... We just
have to go through the whole thing again. And then meanwhile, the child that
we do have is... is at a recital, and... and we're missing it.

Luke : Shut up! I am not! I'm never telling you anything again.

Cameron : I know. I'm as frustrated as you are.

Dylan : Sorry, little dude, but she's gotta go to college, even if that means that
she can't live with me.

Mitchell : Are you? Because I-I don't... I don't know how much more of this I
can take. I am... I am so tired and... and just disappointed. And... I'm just tired.

Claire : Oh, Dylan.

Cameron : Then let's take a break.

Phil : Do you not want her to go to college?
Luke : I don't care.

Mitchell : Really?
Modern Family Season 3x24 page.7

Cameron : It must be exhausting, always keeping it together for the both of us.
And I'm tired, too.

Luke : Here's a coupon for a gun range for mom. I don't know what that's
about.

Mitchell : I think I'm lying on a rock.

Claire : I don't know either. It's...

Cameron : I'm lying next to my rock.

Luke : Report card.
Claire : Mm-hmm.

Gloria : There's certain moments in life that you never forget, like when I held
Manny in my arms for the very first time. I was nervous. I didn't know what I
was doing.

Luke : Report card. Notice from the city to take down the tree house or be
fined $25 a day... Report card. Red light ticket from when me and Manny stole
that...

Haley : What do you think?
Phil : You guys look amazing.
Claire : Oh, our little girl!
Gloria : And I was so excited to see him grow up.
Claire : Bye, sweetie.
Phil : Have fun, man.
Jay : She's asleep. I tell you, kid, I'm too old for this.
Manny : You and me both.
Gloria : And the more he becomes the little man I know today, the more I
know I would do it all over again... Which is good, because I'm going to do it
all over again. Turns out that I wasn't carsick. I'm pregnant.
Phil : Okay, Luke, let's see what else you've been hiding from us.
Luke : Okay, fine. Here's a bill for the birdhouse I blew up at the Dude Ranch.
Claire : You blew up a birdhouse?
Luke : Let's hold all questions until the end. Here's dad's jury duty thing for
the day we went to Disneyland. I didn't want you to cancel the trip.
Phil : Good call.
