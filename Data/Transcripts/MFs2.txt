Modern Family
2x01 : The Old Wagon
Claire : Honey, do you need me to move the car?
Phil : Ho, no! It's nothing. I'm alright. Oh no! Iron cross
Claire : Oh God... Phil... You okay?
Phil : Yes. I am. I am okay.
Claire : Honey, why do we keep this car?
Phil : It's a classic!
Claire : No, it just sits here. And the seatbelts don't work. The
doors stick. It leaks fluids. We haven't put fluids in it in 10 years.
Phil : Well, I'm gonna fix all that anyway. And then, uh, it's gonna
be Haley's car.
Claire : Oh, we're not giving this car to Haley. It's way too easy to
fit a mattress in the back.
Phil : Remember?
Claire : Oh, no. We're selling it.
Phil : What?!

[OPENING CREDITS]
Cameron : "while the spray-tanned starlet claims to be six weeks
sober, sources down under say she has been bar-hopping like a
coked-up kangaroo."
Mitchell : Ah, what's daddy reading to you?
Cameron : If I have to read "the very hungry caterpillar" One more
time, I will snap.
Mitchell : Oh, it's not that bad.
Cameron : I will snap!
Mitchell : So, um, I laid the toolbox outside, And all the supplies
are ready, And I think we are good to go!
Cameron : Terrific.
Mitchell : Aren't you gonna change into a working man's outfit?
Cameron : No, I'm good, And I don't think workmen really call
them "outfits."

Claire : Yeah.

Mitchell : We are building a princess castle for Lily. Uh, it's
something every father wants to be able to do for his daughter.
You know. And I fancy myself as a bit of a castle designer. I have
done a few sketches.

Phil : Seriously?

Cameron : Which we have archived so we can use the kit.

Claire : You can't.

Mitchell : Mm, yeah.

Phil : You honestly think that's gonna work?

Cameron : The kit.

Claire : You can't sell it.

Mitchell : Uh, the kit. Which, uh, we're gonna do together.

Phil : You know what? You can insult a lot of things about me...
My hair, my voice, my balance-board exercises... But don't insult
my selling. That crosses a line. What line? Oh, you don't see it?
That's 'cause I just sold it.

Cameron : I am petrified to do this with Mitchell. He built a
couple of theater sets in college or something, and now he thinks
he knows everything about building. Well, he doesn't. Every

Claire : Mm-hmm. Unless you don't think you can.
Phil : Really?

Modern Family Season 2x01 page.1

home-improvement project that we've undertaken has been a
near-death experience.

Gloria : Oh, I'm sure one won't make a difference. They're
Manny's favorite!
Manny : I...Think I'm going to stop eating trans fats, too.

Cameron : Make the appetizers. And then we'll be...
Luke : Mom? When was this from?
Cameron : If an accident does happen, I hope he kills me...
because I don't think I would be a very inspiring disabled person.

Claire : Oh... That's the year your dad and I went to the rose bowl.
Phil : Incredible game.
Claire : Yeah.

Gloria : Honey, relax. She's not here yet.

Luke : Mom, you look really pretty.

Jay : You might want to play it a little cooler. You don't want to
scare off your girlfriend.

Claire : Thank you, sweetheart.

Manny : She's not my girlfriend! She's just coming over to study
the life cycle of silkworms. Oh. She's here. She's here! Okay, how's
my hair?

Phil : Well, Lukey, everyone gets older. Just 'cause parts of your
mom aren't what they used to be, It doesn't me...

Jay : I thought it was just a friend.
Manny : I heard that.
Jay : I wasn't whispering.
Gloria : Manny, open the door. Make her feel welcome.
Manny : Kelly! Good morning. Uh, I'm glad you're here. Um, this
is my mom.
Gloria : Nice to meet you!

Luke : So, what happened?

Luke : I mean, what happened in the game?
Phil : We got our butts kicked by penn state. The parade was
awesome, though. Angela Lansbury was the grand marshal. "good
time, she wrote."
Claire : Okay, guys. Let's get back to it. No one's gonna buy this
heap looking this way.
Haley : Hey, mom, which one is the garbage can?
Claire : Um, it... Honey, you can't throw that away. It's blankety.
Haley : It's disgusting.

Gloria : In my culture, mothers are very clingy to their sons. In
fact, the leading cause of death among Colombian women is when
their sons get married. But I'm not like that. I just want my Manny
to be happy.
Gloria : Manny, why don't you give your friend Kelly an
empanada?
Kelly : Oh, no, thank you. I try to stay away from trans fats.

Claire : No, sweetie, you loved blankety. You wouldn't go
anywhere without him.
Phil : Yeah, until Luke threw up on it.
Luke : yeah. I used to throw up all the time. Remember buckety?
Claire : Oh! Oh, look at this.
Haley : What is that?
Claire : We went to the beach one day, and had such a good time
that he wanted to being home a jar of sunshine so he could always
remember it. Do you remember, Honey?
Modern Family Season 2x01 page.2

Luke : Oh, no... no, no, don't... don't open it.
Alex : You really think you trapped sunshine in there? I'm just
letting you know now, I'm not taking care of him when you guys
die.

Claire : I'm sorry. I'm sorry. When I woke up this morning, I hated
that car, And even thinking about it made me mad. but then when
we were going through it and blankety... all that stuff... I just... The
thought of that whole part of our life driving away...

Claire : Stop. It's sweet.

Phil : We can keep blankety.

Luke : Still feels hot. Mm.

Claire : I don't want... Look at them. Come on. A minute ago, they
were babies. And now they're driving. And soon we'll all be dead.

Phil : Hey! It's that guy who came by earlier. He was really
interested. What was his name? Shoot!
Phil : Well, you can't be in sales and not remember people's
names. That's why I like to use what they call "minimonic"
devices. They're little tricks to help you remember. Um, like t other
day, I met this guy named Carl. Now, I might forget that name,
But he was wearing a grateful dead t-shirt. What's a band like the
grateful dead? Phish. Where do fish live? The ocean. What else
lives in the ocean? Coral. Hello, "coral."
Claire : I think it's "mnemonic."
Phil : I-I think I'd remember.

Phil : Whoa! You're leaving out a few great minutes there.
Retirement, old age... Cool chair that goes up the stairs.
Claire : Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm...Being ridiculous.
Phil : Don't apologize. I love you when you're human. Listen.
Hey! Listen! We don't have to sell the car.
Claire : Oh, sweetie, of course we do. It doesn't make any sense to
keep it.
Phil : Well, what can I do to make you feel better?
Claire : Nothing. Unless you can build me a time machine.
Phil : Honey... Until someone can figure out how to keep a
wormhole from collapsing in on itself, that's just a pipe dream.
Claire : Sure. Come on back, Phil.

Phil : Okay. You can do it, d. Okay. He looked like the drummer
from Foreigner. Now, Foreigner's from France. France rhymes with
"ants." Ants ruin a picnic. What's up, Nick? Really? Really? Well,
that's great. Yeah, no, swing by anytime. We're here all day.
Thanks. Guess what? You said I couldn't sell this? Well, you're
gonna be eating humble pie stuffed with crow and a big side of
sorry, 'cause I just did. In your face, girl with the negative tattoo!
Honey... Wait.

Mitchell : Well, I found the... I found the nail gun.
Cameron : Oh. Yay.
Mitchell : The weirdest thing... it was wrapped in an old towel
Stuffed in a box on the top shelf of the closet.
Cameron : Well, just set it down on the counter.
Jay : Heads up!

Claire : No!

Mitchell : Oh, dad, what are you doing here?

Luke : Whoa. Someone doesn't like to lose.

Jay : I'm, uh, just, uh, returning that crockpot that Gloria
borrowed.

Phil : Honey. Honey!

Modern Family Season 2x01 page.3

Cameron : Oh, yeah, I forgot you had that crockpot, Jay. Well,
we're just getting ready to build Lily a princess castle if you...
Want to help?
Jay : Yeah, sure.
Cameron : Oh. Well, if it's okay with you, Mitchell.

Kelly : Maybe we should let Manny decide.
Gloria : Okay. Here's the salt. We'll see what he likes.
Manny : Wow! That's really good! Try it, mom!
Gloria : I don't care for it.

Mitchell : Oh, yeah! Oh, no, dad. Oh, remember how much fun
we had when we built that bookshelf together?

Gloria : It was delicious.

Jay : That was my Vietnam. And I was in Vietnam.

Cameron : I finally got Lily down for a nap. Where is Mitchell?
He's not supposed to be unsupervised!

Mitchell : Oh! Look at us! Three construction dudes! Dad, I'm
gonna get you some workman. I have a blue and camel. What's
your preference?
Jay : Surprise me.
Kelly : Wouldn't it be easier If we had all our stuff in the same
notebook?
Manny : You think?
Kelly : I mean, we're always going back and forth. I'll just put my
things in your notebook.
Manny : Okay.
Gloria : Who wants chocolate milk?

Jay : Don't worry. I got him in the garage putting flags on the
spires.
Cameron : Okay, perfect.
Jay : It's better that way. Nobody gets hurt. We don't have to put
flags on the spires.
Cameron : yeah. All right, let's get this roof on. It's supposed to
snap right into place.
Mitchell : Hey!
Cameron : Whatcha got going on over there, jigsaw?
Mitchell : Well, I thought that I would get started on the, uh,
drawbridge while you guys worked on the roof, so...
Jay : You all done with the flags?!

Manny : Sure, mom.

Mitchell : yeah! Yeah, it took me like 15 minutes. It was a lot easier
than you made it out to be.

Gloria : So how is it going?

Cameron : Do something, Jay.

Manny : Great! Kelly's moving her stuff into my notebook.

Jay : Uh, Mitch?!

Gloria : This is sudden.

Mitchell : Yeah.

Kelly : It just felt right. Oh, you know what you should do? Put a
pinch of salt in the chocolate milk. It really brings out the flavor.

Jay : How about you make us some sandwiches?

Gloria : Salt is for the popcorn.

Mitchell : No. No, we're in the middle of this.

Manny : That sounds good.

Cameron : No, I think what Jay's saying is, why don't you go sort
some bolts?

Gloria : You wouldn't like it.

Mitchell : No, I sorted the bolts.
Modern Family Season 2x01 page.4

Cameron : All of 'em?

Phil : Sorry. Don't struggle.

Mitchell : There were six. W-what's going on with you two? Are
you... are you trying to get rid of me?

Claire : Ohh!

Jay : Uh, ... Mitch.

Claire : Great. It's our car.

Mitchell : Oh, my god. You are. You're... you're, like, in cahoots.

Phil : Not a car. Kids?

Cameron : Mitchell, I get scared. when you're around tools, honey,
it's dangerous... for me, for you, for...Our roses.

Claire : "ti..." what?

Jay : Works better this way, kid. I mean, castle goes right up,
nobody gets sliced in half.
Mitchell : Do you know how insulting this is? I was... I was an
intern at the songbird summer playhouse. Do you think that the
town of brigadoon just magically appeared? Well, in the play, it
did, but...The set... the set was built with these two hands!
Cameron : Mitchell. Mitchell...
Mitchell : The Von Trapp mansion, Evita's balcony... Okay. Okay.
Cameron : Oh, where are you going?
Mitchell : I'm going on a walk, And, oh, yeah, I can still do that by
myself. Watch. Oh, I hope I don't get hurt. Oh, god, who put that
doorjamb there? I didn't see it. I ran right into it. Oh, no, I tripped!
Walking is so hard!
Cameron : That one didn't look like it was on purpose.
Mitchell : It was!
Phil : Just a few more steps.
Claire : Oh!
Phil : Oh, sorry! Step! Step! Sorry!
Claire : Phil?!
Phil : Sorry. It's gonna be worth it.
Haley : No, it's not.
Phil : Don't listen to her. And...

Phil : Stop struggling. Ta-da!

Phil : Tonight, Claire Dunphy, we are turning back the clock to a
simpler time... when families piled into their station wagons,
picked up some burgers, and went on a picnic up to granger point.
Claire : Honey, we don't have to do this.
Alex : Listen to her.
Phil : No, it's gonna be great. I talked to... France, ants, picnic...
Nick, and he's not picking up the car till tomorrow. We have one
more night of family fun!
Luke : What's gonna be fun about it?
Phil : Only everything.
Alex : Only nothing.
Claire : Okay, kids, you know what? Your father is trying to do
something nice, so I would appreciate it if you would stop your
whining and just get in the car. Still does it! Oh, my! Come on, get
in, get in!
Phil : Ohhh!
Jay : I'm just saying, the kid's gotta learn to let things go.
Cameron : Well, this is a touchy subject for Mitchell. He wants to
feel like a regular Joe, like you and I. Oh, pardonnez-moi. I prefer
the champagne Dijon to the standard yellow. You know, there are a
few areas that define us as men, like sports and construction.
Mitchell just wants to feel like he's... Part of the man club.
Jay : Isn't that where you guys met?

Claire : Ow. Ow. Ow!
Modern Family Season 2x01 page.5

Cameron : I know you're making a joke because you're
uncomfortable, So I'll let it slide, and we met at an orgy. Come on.
Jay : I just think it's crazy, that's all. So what if he can't swing a
hammer? Look at all he has done. Law school, great career,
providing for his family. That's manly, too, isn't it? I mean, the
classical sense.
Cameron : Well, yes, I mean, I think it also takes a big man to quit
his career as a music teacher and raise a child.
Jay : You're a man, too, Cam.

Gloria : Manny, I think we should talk about this Kelly girl.
Manny : Isn't she great? I think she really likes me.
Gloria : Why wouldn't she like you, baby? Of course. go. Have
fun.
Manny : I'm gonna wear my burgundy dinner jacket.
Gloria : Of course you are.

Cameron : Thank you, Jay. Wait. Garnish. We're men... not
cavemen.

Cameron : I say we apologize and just finish the castle together
like he wanted.

Mitchell : My great-great-grandfather helped build the Brooklyn
bridge. And I heard that, until the day he died, every time he
passed it, he was filled with such pride. He'd say, "there's a little
bit of me in that bridge." I know that I'm not the handiest guy, But
I'm still a man, and I want to be able to look out into my yard and
say... "there's a little bit of me in that princess castle."

Cameron : Absolutely.

Mitchell : Oh, no. No. No, no, no. No. No. Oh, no.
Manny : Hey, mom. Kelly's parents are on their way. She invited
me to go out to dinner and a movie with them. Is that okay?
Gloria : Oh, but... I thought that you and I were going to the
movies tonight. You know, to see that movie with Shia Lebeouf.
Manny : Well, maybe we can go to the movie another night. Wwhat's wrong?
Gloria : Oh, nothing. Just my heart.
Gloria : Okay, sue me. I am a Colombian mother. I'm not gonna let
him make a mistake that is gonna affect him for the rest of my life!
His life!

Jay : Did you hide the nail gun?
Jay : 'cause, I mean, you said that before.
Cameron : No, I... Oh, my gosh. It's finished.
Jay : What the hell? Mitchell did that?
Mitchell : Yes. Yes, Mitchell did it. Who's the bitch now, bitches?
Cameron : Honey, it looks beautiful!
Mitchell : Well, yeah, because when you two were inside enjoying
your little tea party, I was out here... out here getting stuff done.
Cameron : I'm sorry. We shouldn't have underestimated you.
Jay : You know he's stuck in there, right?
Cameron : Oh, yeah.
Jay : Uh, hey, kid, Cam and I are gonna go crack a couple cold
ones. You want to join us?
Mitchell : No, no, you know what? I'm just gonna stay here and
get some stuff done, But you... you two ladies enjoy your light
beers.
Jay : How do you know we're having light beers?
Cameron : We only have light beers. So, well, listen. Here is a
hammer.
Mitchell : I don't need it. I don't need it, though.
Modern Family Season 2x01 page.6

Cameron : ... and this is a screwdriver...

Claire : Okay, Alex, lower your window.

Mitchell : But I'm not gonna use it.

Alex : I can't. It's stuck.

Cameron : ... and you just come on in whenever you want to.

Claire : I forgot about that.

Jay : You sure we shouldn't get him out of there?

Alex : Don't you throw up on me.

Cameron : No. He would never forgive us. He's a very proud
man, your son.

Haley : Don't point him at me!

Mitchell : Bird! Bird! Bird! Ah, oh, my god! Oh, my god!

Phil : Haley!!

Jay : Yeah, I'm pretty proud of myself right now.

Claire : Ohh! Oh-ho.

Mitchell : Ohh! Oh, my god!

Phil : Oh! Oh, honey, I think that's the heat.

Jay : Calm down.

Luke : It's in my mouth. It's happening!

Claire : Here, I'll turn on the...

Claire : Okay, grab a bag!
Claire : Luke, honey, slow down. No one's gonna take your food
away.
Phil : Wow, this place has really changed. Time marches on, huh?
Phil : See that Starbucks down there? You know what that used to
be?
Alex : An orange grove?
Phil : No, a burger king. You can still see some of the architecture.
Claire : Thank you... for this. I really do feel better already.
Phil : You can go home again, Claire.
Claire : Oh, sweetie.
Luke : Mmm. my stomach hurts.
Claire : Luke, honey, I told you not to eat so fast.
Luke : Ohh.
Claire : Just sit back, relax. You're gonna be fine.
Haley : Ew! Spider!
Claire : Haley! Haley, honey, you're standing on the back of
daddy's seatbelt! Haley!
Phil : Oh, soft cheeses, I can breathe again.
Luke : Wait. Where'd the spider go? I really need some air.

Alex : Aah!
Luke : Oh, gosh, it smells like onions!
Alex : My seatbelt's stuck!
Claire : I'll help you. Oh, my god!
Alex : Aah!
Luke : Mm.
Haley : Spider!
Phil : Haley!!
Haley : Oh, god, he's gonna blow, mom!
Luke : I need buckety!
Claire : Okay, everybody get out of the car!
Alex: Our doors don't open!
Phil : We got ya. Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast!
Claire : Get out, get out.
Phil : Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast, Dunphys! Nice and easy!
Claire : Don't look at him! He's just gonna make you feel sick!
Phil : Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast!
Haley : Oh, I looked, I looked, I looked.
Modern Family Season 2x01 page.7

Claire : Ohh, god.
Alex: Guys, the car!
Claire : Whoa!
Phil : I got it!
Claire : Oh, my god. Oh, my god... Oh, no. Oh, no. What's the
plan, Phil?!
Phil : At least I'm trying to do something!
Haley : Dad, get off!
Claire : Come on, Phil! Let it go! Let it go!
Alex : Oh, my god!
Claire : Honey, let it go! Honey! Stop, stop, stop.
Phil : No... oh, no! That's not...
Claire : It's all right.
Phil : I'm just... I'm just being realistic, But we're gonna need to
lower the asking price.
Gloria : Hi, Papi. You're here so soon.
Manny : Yeah. I decided to skip the movie.
Gloria : Are you okay?
Manny : Yeah. Kelly didn't like my jacket. Plus, she ordered for
me.

Manny : She's a girl in my history class. We like to play "six
degrees of sir Francis bacon."
Gloria : You just tossed a woman aside, Immediately you go to the
next one?!
Manny : No, I just...
Gloria : Just... just what?! This is not the way you treat women!
Men are all the same. They break women's hearts, and they don't
care! Men are all animals!
Jay : Hey, honey.
Gloria : Animal!
Phil : The art of the sale is all about... What you leave out. "'83
classic wagon." Tough to find parts. "they don't make 'em like this
anymore." For legal reasons. "enjoyed for many years by one
happy family." Boop... of raccoons. I'm kidding. Actually...
Actually, it did make us happy for a long time. It's gonna be tough
to say goodbye. It always is. Nobody loves change. But... Part of
life is learning to let things go.
Luke : I totally thought I was gonna puke on you.
Haley : I would have killed you if you did.
Alex : Oh, yeah, like you killed that spider?

Gloria : Mm, did she let you hear the specials, at least?

Haley : Oh, you didn't see it. It was huge.

Manny : No. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't get me.
Do we have any trans fats left?

Luke : Remember the look on mom's face when her seat fell
down? How about when dad jumped on the hood of the car?

Gloria : Of course.

Together: "what's the plan, Phil?!"

Manny : Besides, I think there's a girl I'd rather spend time with.
Gloria : Ohh, that's so sweet. I'm the luckiest mother in the world.

Cameron : Mitch? Lily?

Manny, on the phone : Hey. This is Manny. Is Alicia there?

Mitchell: Hey, we're in here!

Gloria : Who's Alicia?

Cameron : Oh! Princess is in her castle! How long have you guys
been out here?
Modern Family Season 2x01 page.8

Mitchell : Ohh. Cam, she can't get enough. We've been in here for
like two hours.
Cameron : Oh, wow!
Mitchell : Yeah.
Cameron : And we did his for her. Mm. Need me to get you out of
there?
Mitchell : This thing is not safe, Cam.
Cameron : Move to the back of the castle.
Mitchell : Yeah, no. I know the drill. No, don't carry me out this
time. I think it sends the wrong message to Lily.
Cameron : Well, the neighbors enjoy it.

Cameron : As much as you loved the other one?

2x02 : The Kiss

Mitchell : Ooh.

Claire : How come we don't have the same number of containers
and lids? Why would they ever get separated?

Cameron : Okay. Mm. The house is on fire. I only have time to
grab one shirt. Which one do I take?
Mitchell : The correct answer is take Lily.

Phil : Built-up resentment, money issues, met a younger lid. Huh?

Cameron : After that.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Mitchell : Uh, okay, the blue one.

Alex : Mom, where's my science homework?

Cameron : Because the gray one washes me out.

Claire : Uh, it's over there on the table. So, Alex, honey, what's
going on? Anything exciting?

Mitchell : No, no. Cam, you... you can't go wrong here.
Everything you've tried on looks great. I love you in both of them.

Alex : No.

Cameron : Oh, you're so nice to me.

Claire : Any boys?
Alex : No.
Claire : I'm feeling a little bit disconnected from Alex right now.
Last week, I picked up her cellphone, thinking it was mine, and I
accidentally read a few flirty text messages that were probably
from a boy in her class, which is fine. Or they're from a drifter.
Claire : Come on, isn't there something you want to share with
your mommers?

Cameron : Mitchell has a problem with public displays of
affection. Um, I remember once at a new year's Eve party, Stroke
of midnight, he high-fived me. Two problems with that... One,
gays don't high-five. Two, gays don't high-five.
Jay : I'm home! Mmm, what smells so good?
Gloria : I'm making chunchullo, a traditional Colombian dish, for
dinner with the family tonight. Chunchullo.
Jay : What is that... like, uh, tacos?

Alex : Yeah. Don't call yourself "mommers."

Gloria : Yes, like tacos.

Phil : He blew his lid when she tried to contain him.

Manny : No, it isn't. It's the small intestine of a pig.
Jay : Oh, geez. Why can't we eat regular food like normal people?

[OPENING CREDITS]
Cameron : Okay. What do you think?
Mitchell : I like it.
Cameron : But you don't love it.
Mitchell : No, I do. I love it.

Gloria : I told you, Jay. My grandmother, who rests in peace, has
been coming to me in my dreams, telling me that I'm losing touch
with my roots.
Jay : See, this is awkward, Because my dead uncle Joe told me to
have steak tonight.
Gloria : No, no, no, Jay. Have some respect. My grandmother can
hear you.
Modern Family Season 2x02 page.1

Manny : What do you mean, she can hear us?
Gloria : Well, in our culture, we believe that the dead are all
around us.

Haley : That's because you get so weird every time a boy comes
near us.
Claire : I-I just don't want you girls to...

Jay : She's right, Manny. She could be right here, her bony fingers
reaching out from the grave.

Haley : To make the same mistakes that you did?

Gloria : Yeah, keep it up, Jay. There's already one dead person in
this room. You want to make it two?

Haley : Mom, I'm not an idiot. I pick up on things. And I don't
think that you were the good girl you pretend you were.

Jay : I'm sorry. I've got a printer to install. Oh, Gloria, have your
grandmother run me up an iced tea in about 10 minutes.

Claire : Wow. That is so untrue. I was a very good girl.

Gloria : Yeah, she has a better chance of making that work than
you! Why don't you save us the stomping and the swearing and
call Phil? He's good at that stuff.
Jay : Better than me? Phil's not better than me at anything, Except
maybe making that stupid sound with his mouth.
Jay : You spit on me.
Claire : Haley, honey, um, I need you to do something for me.
Haley : Ugh. Mom, my arm hurts.
Claire : Why don't you find out what it is before you start making
up excuses to get out of it?
Haley : okay, what is it?
Claire : I need you to talk to your sister. I think that there's
something going on with her and a boy.
Haley : So?
Claire : So, I am your mother, and it is my job to make sure that
you girls don't get involved with a predator.
Haley : Okay, mom, stop watching "dateline." And why can't you
just talk to her?
Claire : I have tried to talk to her. I... she won't talk to me. You
know that.

Claire : No! No.

Claire : Your kids don't need to know who you were before you
had them. They need to know who you wish you were, And they
need to try to live up to that person. They're gonna fall short, But
better they fall short of the fake you than the real you.
Phil : Which is why we don't hide anything.
Claire : That's the opposite of what I just said.
Phil : I was not listening.
Mitchell : Ohh. I'll say it again... I love you in Paisley.
Cameron : Oh, let me lock the door and draw the curtains.
Mitchell : What does that mean?
Cameron : It doesn't mean anything. Good. You know exactly
what it means. You won't kiss me in front of other people because
you're ashamed of who you are. And, yes...I went there.
Mitchell : Okay, you can't say, "yes, I went there," When you go
there all the time. And, by the way, I'm the one who makes
speeches on airplanes every time someone looks at us weird. I'm
the one who gives my dad hell when he refers to you as my
"friend."
Cameron : That's different. That's confrontation. But you know
what takes real strength?
Mitchell : Whining?
Modern Family Season 2x02 page.2

Cameron : Affection.

Alex : I'm not talking to you about this.

Mitchell : Oh, this is insane. Buying a shirt... it's not a kiss-worthy
moment.

Haley : Oh, come on. You're finally interesting. Just tell me.

Cameron : Oh, I didn't know there was an official list. Please, tell
us... what is on the list?
Mitchell : I'll tell you what's not on the list... Finding jalapeñostuffed olives, making the light on maple, every time we see a v.W.
Cameron : You don't like "kiss-buggy"?
Mitchell : It's not a real game! It... it's just another way for you to
be needy. I... and I don't appreciate you making me feel bad
because I can't live up to your impossible standards. Nobody
kisses at a bowling alley!

Alex : He's not my boyfriend. It's Jeremy Reed. It's... he's just this
boy that I...
Haley : Love?
Alex : No!
Haley : Well, have you guys kissed yet?
Alex : No!
Haley : Well, what are you waiting for?
Alex : I'm not waiting. I'm 13.
Haley : And you've never kiss a boy?

Cameron : I almost got a turkey!

Alex : How old were you?

Phil : "yello"? Oh, hey, jay. Just a sec. I'll go get Claire.

Haley : Like 11. And it was beautiful. I was in Jackson Kaner's
carpeted garage.

Jay : Oh, actually, it's you I'm calling. What was that?
Phil : The cat. There's a cat. What's up?
Jay : Well, Gloria's been missing her grandmother. I've been trying
to get this old picture of her printed, But I can't get this new
printer to...

Alex : 11?
Haley : Yeah. So you better get on it, or else he's gonna think
you're a lesbian.
Alex : He's not going to think I'm a lesbian.
Haley : I thought you were. You totally have the sandals for it.

Phil : I'll be right there. Luke, grandpa needs us!
Phil : Hells yes, I was glad to get the call. Jay's always around here
fixing things, Cracking jokes about my "delicate hands" or my gag
response to the smell of paint. Look who needs me now... Mr. Hotdog fingers who can't press "print" Without hitting three extra
keys. Yeah! You're in my house now, Jay! T-technically, we'll be in
his house, But we'll be in my area... of his house.

Phil : Let's see this bad boy. Oh, a p-750. Nice unit. I would have
sprung for the 840, But I get it... Not everyone can handle that
kind of horsepower.
Jay : I thought maybe the cordless phone was interfering, So I
unplugged it.
Phil : Good idea. Maybe we should run downstairs and unplug
the toaster while we're at it.
Luke : oh, snap, dad. Toaster.

Haley : So, I hear you have a boyfriend.
Alex : No, I don't.
Haley : Who is he?

Phil : We're kidding. A cordless phone is 5.8 gigahertz. This is wifi. It's a totally different spectrum. Walk with me? Here's a little
trick that I've found pretty useful with Claire. * the computer and
Modern Family Season 2x02 page.3

the printer must talk, talk, talk * "command-p" makes the picture
walk, walk, walk *

Jay : What do you need?

Luke : How come it's not working?

Jay : Do what?

Phil : It should be. Okay. Uh, that should be printing. So...

Gloria : In Colombia, when you cook in honor of the departed,
You have to scare death away from the food to protect the people
that are gonna eat it. Slap it and yell.

Jay : Hey, Phil, I'm gonna get a beer, beer, beer before I hit you in
the head, head, head.

Gloria : Slap the chicken.

Jay : That's the nuttiest...
Jeremy : Hey. What are you doing here?

Gloria : Jay!

Alex : Hi, Jeremy. I want to ask you something.

Jay : Calm down. Give me the chicken. Here we go.

Jeremy : Sure, ask...

Gloria : Mm-hmm. That's not scaring anything away. When my
grand-mother used to cook, The whole house would she.

Alex : wait, don't talk yet. We've texting for a while, and it's been
nice, But I feel like it's leading to something else, And I don't know
if you do or not, but I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm just a girl
standing in front of a boy asking for him to like her. Oh, god, that's
from "Notting hill." So dorky. but a really underrated movie.
Jeremy : What's happening?
Alex : I'm not a lesbian. I would like for you to kiss me.
Jay : Oh, I love watching you stir.

Jay : Aah! Aah! Aah!
Gloria : Louder.
Jay : Aah!
Gloria : Higher. Louder! Higher! Louder! There!
Gloria : I made all that up. That is not a real custom in Colombia.
We're not lunatics. but you mess with us, and we mess with you.
That's the custom.

Gloria : Then I will stop.
Jay : What? Are you still mad at me?
Gloria : Yes. You have to apologize for making fun of my culture,
my beliefs, my chunchullo, my abuela.
Jay : I'm sorry. If you think your grandmother's here with us, I
respect that. Now, come here. Oh, grandma! Where'd you come
from? We're gonna have to get you a little bell.
Gloria : Enough, Jay! My culture is very important to me! I've
been working all day to share it with your family tonight, and all
you do is mock me! Just go!
Jay : Honey, I'm sorry. I'm just teasing you.
Gloria : Instead of being the comedian, why don't you help me?

Gloria : Louder!
Claire : Hey, honey. Where'd you go?
Alex : Nowhere. Just for a bike ride.
Haley : Oh, my god! Puh-lease tell me this text is wrong! Did you
really just go over to that kid's house and try and kiss him in front
of a million people?!
Claire : Alex, did you do that?
Alex : You got a text?
Haley : Oh, yeah. Everybody knows. Do you know how
embarrassing this is for me?
Modern Family Season 2x02 page.4

Alex : This is all your fault! You're the one who said I had to kiss
him or I was a lesbian!

Luke : Ghost of Manny's great-grandma, If that's really you, show
yourself!

Claire : Haley! Did you say that to her?!

Manny : That's her!

Haley : Oh, don't turn this on me. Look at her shoes!

Luke : Aah!

Alex : Ugh! I'm never going back to school now.
Claire : No, sweetheart. Yes, you are. You are going back to school.
But listen to me... Just because a boy sends you flirty texts doesn't
mean that you have to text him back...
Alex : what?! You read my texts?!
Claire : I...
Haley : You read her texts?! That's why you made me talk to her?!
Alex : You made her talk to me?!
Claire : I kind of feel like we're spinning out here a little bit. Look,
Alex, the important thing here is that you have to be very careful
how you behave around boys because it is so easy to get a
reputation.
Alex : Well, I'm sorry I'm not a perfect little good girl like you
were!
Haley : Were you?
Claire : Ohh.
Haley : Were you?! I highly doubt it!
Luke : Don't be such a chicken, there's no ghost in here.
Manny : I'm telling you, my mom said her dead grander was in
the house. She said she felt her here this morning... in this room.
Luke : Maybe your mom's mentally ill.
Phil : who puts a router... in the attic?

Phil : Come on! Why?! Why?!!
Haley : Hi, grandpa.
Jay : How we doing, girls?
Alex : Mom ruined my life today.
Claire : I didn't ruin your life. I was....
Alex : Don't even talk to me! I didn't even want to come here.
Jay : Well, okay. Snacks and sodas are in the living room, but don't
fill up... we've got intestines coming.
Claire : Uh, dad, if you're looking for your shoes, I think I know
where they are.
Jay : This happens to be a Colombian custom... walking in the
footsteps of the ancestors, blah, blah, blah. Beats slapping the
chicken.
Cameron : Here, I brought you a drink.
Mitchell : Oh, wait a minute... sip it first.
Cameron : I'm not mad at you. I thought about it, and maybe
you're right. I can be a little needy sometimes.
Mitchell : Oh, well, I-I appreciate that. And you're probably not
entirely off base. I mean, lord knows I-I've got my quirks. And II'm not the most demonstrative guy around, But I'm... I'm working
on it.
Cameron : And I'm gonna help you with it.
Mitchell : Good. Just don't give up on me.

Luke : Did she have a limp and a cane?

Cameron : Never.

Manny : Uh-huh.
Modern Family Season 2x02 page.5

Gloria : Okay, everybody, let's gather around! Jay, come here.
Tonight we dine on the traditional Colombian recipes of my
abuela, my grandmother. And even though she's no longer with
me, I am very happy because I have all of you. To Ana-Maria Rosa
de la Immaculada Jimenez Morales.
All : To Ana-Maria Rosa...
Cameron : That was beautiful, Gloria, just like my Mitchell.
Mitchell : Just slipped right off there.
Gloria : Ay, Cameron, what happened? One moment you were
there, the next, only shoes.
Cameron : I'll tell you what happened... Mitchell is embarrassed to
kiss me in front of other people.
Mitchell : No, you ambushed me!
Claire : Oh, Cam, come on. Don't take it personally. When Mitchell
was in high school, He was dating this girl... Robin Schier. He
would never kiss her, either.
Mitchell : That's because I was gay.
Cameron : What's your excuse now?
Gloria : Ay, Cameron, it's not Mitch's fault. He gets it from his
father. Jay doesn't like the lovey-dovey in public, either.
Jay : I can't believe you're coming at me right now. I'm standing
here with shoes around my neck, And for the better part of a halfhour, I screamed the death out of your meat. Now, what do you
want from me?

Mitchell : We don't.
Cameron : Of course we don't.
Mitchell : Oh, I'm sorry that I don't want to make out with you in
front of my whole family.
Jay : No need to apologize.
Claire : Oh, Gloria is right. Dad, you being so emotionally closed
off makes it very difficult for your children to show affection.
Jay : Really?
Claire : Yes.
Jay : You had trouble showing affection in public places?
Claire : Yes!
Jay : You?
Claire : Yes.
Jay : Was that before or after you were delivered to my door in a
squad car, Wearing nothing but your underwear and a police
blanket?
Haley : Oh, my god. What?
Alex : You were arrested?
Luke : Awesome!
Claire : Not awesome. And I wasn't arrested. Your grandfather
was just telling a joke.
Jay : It was just a joke. I got a million of 'em.
Claire : Dad.

Mitchell : Don't say "lover."

Phil : I did it! It's printing! I had to download new firmware,
install new drivers, Change your encryption, and replace an
ethernet cable in a 100-degree attic, while dodging particularly
aggressive spiders, But I did it!

Cameron : we don't like "lover."

Jay : Thanks.

Jay : Can we just eat?

Phil : Oh. Okay. I guess that's it.

Claire : No. Tell Mitch that it's okay to kiss cam in front of you.

Jay : What? What's it?

Gloria : Don't you see? It's because of you that your son cannot
kiss his own lover.

Jay : Why is that something we have to do?
Modern Family Season 2x02 page.6

Gloria : Wake up, dummy. This is what we're talking about. This
guy's been working like an imbecile all day for you. People need
something else... kisses, hugs.

Claire : Come on. Come on, do it. You're in front of your
grandchildren.

Jay : What, for fixing a printer?

Mitchell : W-what, now? Well, I feel weird now.

Phil : Oh, it's fine. It was only four hours. I tipped over a paint can
and threw up a little, but I think... I think "thanks" about covers it.

Jay : Don't be coy. What are you waiting for, a box of chocolates?
Let's do this.

Jay : Well, what's wrong with "thanks"?

Cameron : That's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.

Claire : It's pretty much the bare minimum, dad.

Jay : All right, and now because I never want to hear this again...
you.

Manny : Jay, for god's sakes, just say something.

Jay : All right, all right! Shut up! Mitch, get over here.

Jay : You want me to say something? How about "you're
welcome"? How about "I'm... I'm so happy to be here for you all so
I can take the blame for all your crap." I can't do this, I never did
that. Trust me, I gave you twice as much as my father ever gave
me. The man kissed me one time in my entire life. He came up
behind me, kissed me on the back of the head, Said, "goodnight,
Becky." He thought I was my sister.

Phil : Ohh.

Gloria : Wait a minute. When was the last time you kissed Mitch?

Claire : Alex, wait.

Jay : What does that have to do with anything?

Alex : What?

Gloria : Mitch, when was the last time he kissed you?

Claire : I want to talk to you.

Mitchell : I-I don't remember.

Alex : Mom, I don't want another lecture.

Jay : It wasn't that long ago.

Claire : It's not a lecture. I want to tell you something. Honey, I
know exactly how you're feeling.

Mitchell : I was 12.
Gloria : 12? This is the problem! Jay's dad doesn't kiss Jay, So Jay
doesn't kiss Mitch, and Mitch is uptight.
Mitchell : Okay, okay, "uptight" was really not on the table. This is
more about kissing.
Gloria : Jay, kiss your son. He's a mess.
Jay : Oh, come on, now.
Mitchell : We don't have to do that. It's...
Gloria : Yes, you do.
Mitchell : No.

Jay : Not you.
Claire : Oh, daddy, I love you.
Gloria : Let's go eat chunchullo!
Manny : You know it's made of pig intestines, right?

Alex : No, you don't.
Claire : Okay, the... the joke that grandpa told tonight? That... that
happened. That...that was true.
Alex : So, you were arrested naked?
Claire : I wasn't naked! And I was not arrested per se. I was driven
home one night by the police because my boyfriend and I had
gone swimming in somebody's pool, And we didn't have bathing
suits and... blah, blah, blah, the details aren't important. What
matters is that everybody at school was talking about it. And I
thought I would die. But it passed. I swear. And now, honey, I'm...
Modern Family Season 2x02 page.7

I'm glad it happened. I've got a funny story to tell at dinner
parties.

Jay : Just another nice thing I did for you while you made a fool of
me. Manny let me in on your little tricks. You feel bad now?

Alex : So, how long did it take before you thought it was funny?

Gloria : No. I feel good. Mm.

Claire : Oh, god... 10, 15 years.
Alex : Great. What do I do about tomorrow?

Gloria : That one is definitely my favorite.

Claire : I don't think you have to worry about that. Go, go, go.
Claire : Phil, you really don't have to do this.
Gloria : In Colombia, we kiss for everything because a kiss can
mean so many different things.

Phil : No. I-I can do it. I want to do it. It's silly to pay someone else
just to do something... Oh! Oh, no! Oh!
Claire : Oh, wait! No, no, don't spill it! Sweetie, don't spill that!

Manny : There's no ghost in here, is there?

Phil : Oh! Oh, that's on me!

Jay : Not a chance. Sleep easy, kid.

Claire : Careful! Oh, gosh! Oh! Okay, get up. You're fine. Get it off!
Okay, I got it. I got it.

Gloria : It can be the start of something new. It can be how we say,
"this is the person that I love."

Phil : Got it off. Got it off. Oh, the face! Not the face! Oh, the face!
Claire : All right, I'll pull it down!
Phil : Ohh!

Cameron : So who's a better kisser, me or your dad?

Claire : You're good!

Mitchell : Ew.

Phil : It's on me.
Claire : All right, I'm gonna have to... I'll cut it off.

Gloria : It can be romantic.

Phil : Good idea. Get a bucket, please!

Jeremy : Just so you know, if my friends weren't there, I would've
said yes. So, if you still want to...
Alex : If it's okay... maybe we should hang out more first. This is
only the second conversation we've had that wasn't by text.
Jeremy : Whew!
Gloria : It can also be worth waiting for.
Gloria : Jay, what is this?
Modern Family Season 2x02 page.8

Modern Family
2x03 : Earthquake

Phil : Uh, no, we did not.
Claire : Oh. Yes. We did! We did!
Phil : We did?

Haley : Oh, my God, mom, the party is like 'round the block. I'd be
gone for two hours.

Claire : Plumber, hi. Yeah. Um, it's right up at the top of the stairs.

Claire : That is two hours you could spend studying.

Plumber : Thank you.

Haley : I had been studying all weekend. No friends, no phone,
just me alone with books. I feel like Alex...

Phil : But didn't I tell you I'd fix the tub?

Alex : You're never alone when you have books.
Claire : Really?
Haley : Is that what you want me to turn into?
Claire : Sweetheart, listen to me. This is the S.A.T.S. Okay? It is not
some stupid science quiz.

Phil : Really, Claire?

Claire : Yes, honey, you did, And I think I was pregnant with Luke
at the time.
Phil : That is not fair. I've done everything you've asked me to do
around here. I fixed the step, didn't I? Look how solid it is! I'm like
Shirley Temple and that black guy!
Plumber : Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.

Hey, if science quizzes are so stupid, why do you put mine up on
the refrigerator?

Phil : Bill "Bojangles" Robinson! I said it first!

Haley : Because we feel sorry for you, 'cause books are your
friends.

Phil : Yeah, it's a cracked washer... If I know my washers. And it's,
uh, it's been leaking a little water.

Alex : Yeah, she wasn't studying last night. She was video-chatting
the whole time.

Plumber : Yeah, could be a washer, A cracked valve, a stripped
pipe.

Haley : Shut up!

Phil : Well, I guess I'm not a professional plumber, But I have
spent a huge amount of time in that tub. I can tell you from
experience, or at least what it feels like in there...

Claire : I knew it. I knew it.
Haley : You are such a tattletale!

Claire : So, this is the problem. Uh, faucet just keeps leaking.

Claire : Girls, take it down a notch, because I...
Phil : whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the hot topic on "the view" today,
ladies?

[OPENING CREDITS]

Haley : Dad, can you just please tell mom that I can take a twohour break and go to a party?

Mitchell :Oh, good. You're back. I need you to help settle a spat
between our blacksmith and the chimney sweep.

Phil : No, ma'am. I'm not stepping into that one. We're not playing
good cop/mom. I got it. You know, you just bought yourself an
extra... Hello.

Cameron : Be nice. It took me 20 minutes to find my opera cloak.

Plumber : You call for a plumber?

Mitchell :I still can't believe you didn't have to rent any of that.
Cameron : Oh, please. Do you know how many times this has
paid for itself?
Modern Family Season 2x03 page.1

Mitchell :Has it?

Manny : And before that, you thought you had a cold that turned
out not to be a cold.

Cameron : Well, our friend Pepper loves to throw theme parties.

Jay : Because I babied it.

Mitchell :Yes, he does, and this weekend is his first annual "Oscar
Wilde and Crazy Brunch."

Gloria : You don't have to convince us. You have to convince him.

Cameron : We're still recovering From his "Studio 54th of July"
barbecue. They were fun at first.

Gloria : How would you know?

Mitchell :Uh...

Jay : Who, God? Me and God are good!
Jay : Look, you feel God in church, which is great. I feel God out in
nature, amongst his works.

Cameron : But they have become a lot of work. You have to dress
in costume.

Gloria : Are you gonna go to church next week?

Mitchell :You have to assume a character. I... I can't believe you
ever dated him.

Gloria : I know what "we'll see" means. If you're done with
church, just say it.

Cameron : One date. It was the '90s. We'd just lost Princess Di. I
was at sea.

Jay : I'm done with church.

Mitchell :Oh, Cam, can we just... Can we please cancel?
Cameron : I wish we could, But you know he's still mad at us for
missing passover.
Mitchell :Oh. Right. "Seder-day night fever"?
Cameron : Just go get dressed and powdered.
Mitchell :Ohh. Pepper has done the impossible! He's made two
gay men hate brunch.
Jay : You know, it might be easier just to pour the espresso right in
the sugar.
Manny : Every morning.
Gloria : Jay, what are you wearing? You can't go to church like
that.
Jay : Well, that settles it, then. I'm going golfing.
Gloria : You're gonna miss church again? Last Sunday, you said
that you had to go to the office. The week before, you had
breakfast with a friend.

Jay : We'll see.

Gloria : Don't say that!
Jay : Look... I'm not going to church anymore. It's not the end of
the world. Let's not make a big deal out... Hell...
Gloria : Aah! Aah!
Manny : Earthquake!
Gloria : Iterremoto! Vamos, vamos, Manny! Vamos, Jay!
Phil : Girls?!
Claire : Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. This is... this is stuck!
Cameron : We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
Mitchell :We better not. If they find us in these outfits, It's gonna
be very bad for the gays.
Phil : Claire?!
Alex : We're okay!
Luke : Dad?
Modern Family Season 2x03 page.2

Phil : Luke! Buddy. You okay?

Alex : Dad, get up here!

Luke : That thing almost fell on me! I was sitting there, And it
came this close to my head!

Phil : On my way... seriously, I just fixed that!

Phil : It's all right. You're okay. You didn't get hurt.

Phil : What's wrong?

Luke : Well, I'm not gonna wait around here until I do. Ohh.

Alex : Mom's stuck!

Phil : O...kay. Wow! That is a doozy.

Phil : You okay in there?

Alex : Haley...

Claire : We're fine. The door is jammed.
Mitchell :Hey, are you guys okay?

Phil : Oh. Okay. Uh... well, let's... let's try this together, okay?

Phil : Yeah, we're fine. You?

Claire : Okay.

Mitchell :We're fine. That was really... Oh, wait. Hold on. Hello?

Phil : Um, I'm gonna push. You pull.

Gloria : Mitch, are you okay?

Claire : Okay.

Mitchell :We're okay. We're okay.

Phil : On three. 1, 2, 3...

Gloria : And Phil and Claire?

Claire : Aah! Nothing!

Mitchell :Uh, I'm on the other line with them right now. One
second. Hello? Oh, shoot, we lost Phil.

Phil : Oh, dang!

Gloria : We lost Phil?!
Cameron : We lost Phil?
Gloria : Hello?
Mitchell :Great. Now Gloria's gone.
Cameron : Gloria's gone, too? Ohh!
Phil : Hey, Gloria.
Gloria : Ay, dios mio, Phil, you're alive!
Phil : Yeah, of course I'm alive. For now.
Phil : For months, Claire has been after me and dogging me...
"what if we have an earthquake? We've got kids in the house."
Blah blah blah. So it finally reached the point where I had no
choice but to just roll up my sleeves and tell her I did it.

Phil : Okay, here's the thing. I wasn't pushing. In fact, I was
pulling a little. It dawned on me that as long as Claire was stuck in
the bathroom, I'd have time to anchor the cabinet to the wall. It's
like they say... Sometimes when god closes a door, He closes it so
hard that your wife can't get out.
Phil : So, don't panic! I'm gonna get you out! I'm just gonna go get
some tools!
Plumber : Get a crowbar if you have one!
Phil : What is that supposed to mean? Like I'm some dandy who
doesn't have a crowbar?
Plumber : Well, you did just use the word "dandy."
Phil : "Dandy" is a term coined by miners in the 15th century.
Claire : Phil? Just get us out of here.

Claire : Aah. Phil!
Modern Family Season 2x03 page.3

Haley : Dad, how long is it gonna take to get her out of there?
Phil : Long time.

Mitchell :Yeah, but Pepper doesn't know that. You'll just tell him
that we have some damage we have to deal with.

Claire : Oh, honey. Don't worry. Mommy is gonna be out soon.
Don't panic. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're not going to that
party, young lady.

Cameron : Why me?

Haley : No, I'm not going to the party. I'm just going downstairs.

Pepper : Hello?

Alex : With your purse?

Cameron : I'm a bad liar. Do not hand me that.

Haley : Come on. Just cover for me this one time, and I... I'll drive
you wherever you want.

Mitchell :He is on the phone right now. Pick up. You are doing it! I
think somebody's talking.

Alex : I want to go to the Museum of Tolerance.

Pepper : Hello?

Haley : Fine. How far is tolerance?

Cameron : Hi! Pepper! Listen... hi. Hey. It's Cameron. How are you
doing over there?

Claire : I can hear the two of you scheming out there! Don't you
dare leave this house!
Haley : Ohh, why do you have to be such a psycho control freak?!
Claire : Okay, you know what? Just for that, you are grounded one
week!

Mitchell :Because I'm the one that always cancels.
Cameron : No, do not hand me that. I will not talk to him.

Pepper: Great.
Cameron : Well, the earthquake. Yeah, it was huge here. Huge. So,
obviously, we're not... We're not gonna be able to make it.
Pepper : Why not?

Haley : Oh, that's good parenting!

Cameron : Well, some dishes broke.

Claire : Okay. Two weeks. Want to double it?! Keep talking!

Pepper : You can sweep them up later.

Haley : Blah blah blah blah blah!

Cameron : And, uh, well, yeah, I guess... I guess we could sweep
those up, um, later. Our, uh, our... our hat rack. Our hat rack fell
through the window.

Claire : Fine! Four weeks! Four!
Haley : Double it again and make it 10 weeks!
Alex : Oh, my God! Do you not hear how much you need to
study?!
Cameron : Mitchell, come on. We're gonna be late.
Mitchell :Ohh, I can't believe we have to do this.
Cameron : Come on, after the earthquake, it might be nice to be
around similarly dressed people.
Mitchell :That makes no... the earthquake! Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes.
This...okay. This is the perfect excuse.
Cameron : Why? We're fine.

Pepper : Hat rack?
Cameron : Well, yeah, we do have a hat rack. We thought it would
force us to wear our hats more. And it did. And there's water
damage. There's water everywhere. A bookshelf fell on Mitchell's
leg. Mitchell's hurt, Pepper. Mitchell's hurt real bad.
Pepper : I'm coming right over.
Cameron : No, you don't need to come over.
Pepper : I'm coming!
Cameron : Pepper, no! He's coming over. See? Kind of panicked.
Mitchell :You did panic, Cam. You panicked real bad.
Modern Family Season 2x03 page.4

Jay : Probably good for us to spend a little time together.
Gloria : You're still going golfing?! God sent you a sign, Jay!

Gloria : You're gonna spend eternity together!

Jay : What, the earthquake? You got to be kidding me.

Jay : Ohh. Damn it! I suppose that was god, too!

Gloria : You say that you're never going to church again, And the
ground shakes with a vengeance.

Gloria : I don't know who did it, but it makes me happy.

Jay : I'll prove it to you. God, if you have a problem with me
golfing...
Gloria : Shh!

Jay : Aah!
Luke : What are you doing?

Jay : ...send me a sign! I mean, throw in a little lightning! Put on a
show!

Phil : Hey, buddy. Oh, just double-checking these straps. This is an
extra. These babies saved your life. That's why this cabinet barely
moved.

Gloria : Don't talk to God like that!

Luke : It fell all the way to the couch.

Jay : Trust me, if God had a problem with me, he would let me
know without shaking the whole city. He would be a little more
specific.

Phil : Mnh-mnh.

Gloria : I'm not gonna argue with you. I don't want to get upset.
Vamanos, Manny.
Manny : I think I'm gonna skip it today.
Gloria : What?!
Manny : I like what Jay said about God being in nature.
Gloria : No, no, no, no. Don't listen to him. His days are
numbered!
Manny : Think about it, mom. It makes sense. God made the trees
and the grass. He didn't make that church.
Gloria : But he made the people that make the church, And you're
making me angry! Vamanos.
Manny : Just one week. Can I go golfing with you?
Jay : Well, I'm probably gonna have a Latino kid carry my clubs
anyway. Might as well be you.
Gloria : Fine! See what I care! Go!
Jay : Manny. Go change.
Manny : Sorry, mom. Hope you understand.

Luke : It almost killed me.
Phil : No, it didn't. This cabinet barely moved. That's just
perspective playing tricks on your mind. Like if I hold up my
thumb, it looks bigger than your head.
Luke : No, it doesn't. It looks tiny.
Phil : You have to look at it from over here.
Luke : How can I look at my head from over there?
Claire : Phil?
Phil : Why don't you just lie down? I got to make sure your mom's
still stuck. So she... I can get her out. Don't fall asleep. Sorry that
took... you filthy... Sorry that took so long! I'm gonna go ahead and
just take off the doorknob, okay?
Claire : Okay!
Phil : There we go. That's... oh, damn!
Claire : What? What happened?
Phil : I, uh, brought the wrong screwdriver, So I'll be right back!
Claire : All right, but hurry up, Phil!
Phil : Doing my best, Claire!
Haley : Oh, don't talk back, dad! She'll just ground you!
Modern Family Season 2x03 page.5

Claire : That's 32 weeks, young lady! I was at 16 before, right?
What?

Jay : Huh. Look at that. That's a perfect shot. And I hit that with a
bent club.

Plumber : Nothing.
Claire : Don't judge me until you've had a teenage girl.

Manny : So you're not worried about getting in trouble? You
know, with god?

Plumber : I've had four of 'em.

Jay : Oh, I think he's got bigger things on his plate.

Claire : God, how did you survive that?

Manny : So you're not worried about hell?

Plumber : Girls were a piece of cake. It was the boy every look on
his face. Every stupid decision he made, the way he sat there,
chewing his food like an idiot. And then it hit me why this kid
drove me so crazy. He's me.

Jay : Let me let you in on a little secret, kid. There is no hell.

Claire : Well, all the more reason she should listen to me. I can
stop her from making the same mistakes.

Manny : Even bad people?

Manny : Seriously? No hell? That's fantastic! So everyone just goes
to heaven?
Jay : Yep. End of story.

Plumber : Did you listen to your mother?

Jay : Yeah, they're... they're... they're another section, see? They got
this thing figured out. Can I hit this? Damn it. You distracted me.

Claire : Oh, God no. But, you know, I had a reason. That woman
was a psycho control... Freak.

Manny : I didn't say anything!

Luke : Hey, mom. I brought you some soda. But I couldn't find
any straws, so you'll have to drink it like cats.
Claire : Oh! Thank you, Luke! That's my sweetie.
Luke : I was going to bring you wine, But you finished the big
bottle last night.
Claire : Okay. Off you go.
Luke : I was...
Jay : Hold this, will you, kid?
Manny : Sure.
Jay : You know, Mitchell used to caddy for me. Of course, he spent
most of his time chasing butterflies.
Manny : You won't catch me doing that.
Jay : Good for you.
Manny : I'm terrified of them.

Jay : I could hear you thinking.
Manny : I'm thinking about this heaven of your that's full of bad
people.
Jay : Not full. The tiniest fraction, they're walled in.
Manny : What if they break out?
Jay : They're surrounded by a lake of fire.
Manny : They are fiery lakes in heaven? This is turning into hell.
Jay : Tell me about it.
Cameron : What are you doing?!
Mitchell :Well, you promised Pepper broken dishes, so... I'm
breaking dishes.
Cameron : No! Not my frog! I know you think it's tacky, but I
happen to have won this at my first 4-h summer camp in a
hollerin' contest.
Mitchell :Well, we wouldn't have to break anything if you were a
better liar.
Modern Family Season 2x03 page.6

Cameron : If you're trying to make me feel bad about not being as
good a liar as you... What are you doing?

Mitchell :We're all out of cassis.

Mitchell :A hat rack fell through the window, remember? One...
Two... Three!

Mitchell :I will make you a Bellini.

Cameron : Mitchell, wait! I-I-I can't do this. I quit. You might be
comfortable with all this lying, but I'm not.
Mitchell :Oh, please. Where was all this conscience when I got us
into the first-class lounge at the airport and you chewed Angela
Lansbury's ear off. You know what you are? You're like a mob
wife. You look down at me and my ways, But you're happy to
wear the mink coat that fell off the back of the truck!
Cameron : How dare you?
Mitchell :I know. I know. It really hit us bad.
Pepper : No. I'm just always surprised how small this place is.
Cameron : Pepper, you didn't have to leave your party to come
check on us. Great costume, by the way.
Pepper : This isn't my costume. I just threw this on to help you
clean up.
Cameron : Well, about your party...
Pepper : Oh, don't worry about canceling. At least you have an
excuse, unlike Steven and Stefan, they said they had the flu.
Meantime, I just saw them out riding their bicycle.
Mitchell :Oh, Pepper, that is horrible. I-I'm gonna make you a
cocktail.
Pepper : Oh, honey. Don't go to any trouble. I'll just have a Kir
Royale. I mean, my god, if they didn't want to come to my party,
Just say it. I'm a big boy. I can take it.

Pepper : I can't bear it!
Pepper : Everybody canceled on me! And now you two! For 15
years, I have killed myself setting a community standard with my
fanciful themed brunches mounted at great personal expense.
Well, clearly, I've been a fool. No one likes your brunches, Pepper.
No one likes you. You're gonna die alone! In a quaint Spanish
revival outside of Palm Springs... or La Quinta.
Cameron : Yeah. I told him.
Mitchell :Yeah. Yeah, I puzzled that out.
Manny : I just don't understand this bad section of heaven. What
if they send you to the wrong place? They make mistakes with
paperwork sometimes. I was put in a girls' health class last year an
had to watch a very disturbing movie.
Jay : Calm down. Instead of thinking all morning about what
heaven's gonna look like, What it's not gonna look like, who's
where, If there even is a heaven, why don't we just concentrate on
this beautiful, carefree day that's in front of us?
Manny : I'd rather concentrate on something you just said. There
might not even be a heaven?
Jay : I don't know!
Manny : You seemed pretty sure of yourself this morning. So what
happens after you die? There's just nothing?
Jay : Look, you're focusing too much on one little thing that I said.
It was just a hunch, okay?

Cameron : Well, since you brought it up, Pepper... we didn't want
to come to your party, either.

Manny : A hunch? I'm skipping church based on a hunch?!

Pepper : What?

Manny : You're playing pretty fast and loose with my soul.

Cameron : Well, you know we love you, But they've just gotten to
be so much work over the years, and...

Jay : Listen. I want you to forget everything that I said, okay?

Jay : All right, don't freak out on me here, kid.

Modern Family Season 2x03 page.7

Manny : Some things can't be forgotten, Jay. Do you know what
menstruation is? Because I do.
Phil : Perfect. Hey!
Alex : W-what are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be getting
mom out of the bathroom?
Phil : That is what I was doing. That is what I was doing. This c…
this cabinet... was the problem.
Alex : How?
Phil : Yeah. It's very heavy, And because it was properly anchored
to the wall, There's sort of a ripple effect. It was... pulling part of
the floor down... and then pushing part of the floor up, using the
bathroom door... Please don't tell on me.
Pepper : I don't know who I am anymore! Who am I?! I'm a joke!
That's who.
Cameron : No, no. You're not a joke. You're Pepper Saltzman.
Pepper : I think I better just go. If anything terrible should happen,
don't feel an obligation to attend my memorial. New York or L.A.

Mitchell :Yeah, and it's just... it's very hard for him to be around
you, especially at your... magical brunches where you're just...
You're... you're so... magnetic. And then I see the way that he looks
at you, and... Damn it, Pe... it just makes me so mad that I could
just... Ohh!
Cameron : Really?
Mitchell :Yeah, oh, you don't know the pain, Cam!
Pepper : Oh, boys! Boys, I can't stand that I'm coming between
you! Not that I'm surprised. I admit I have noticed the stolen
glances and the yearning in your eyes.
Mitchell :Okay. Well, y-you'll forgive us, Pepper, If we sit out your
next few brunches?
Pepper : Absolutely. I would hate to lose you two. I've always
thought of you as being like my...
Cameron : Sons? Sons?
Pepper : "Sons"? I was gonna say "brothers." It's like a house of
pain!

Cameron : Pepper? Pepper, you... you didn't let me finish. The
reason we didn't want to come to your party is... Mitchell?

Plumber : All right, Claire.

Mitchell :Seriously?

Plumber : You ready?

Claire : Okay, ready?
Claire : I'm ready.

Mitchell :Who's a mob wife?

Plumber : All right, on "go." Okay, go.

Cameron : I'm a mob wife.

Claire : All right? Go! Go! Go! Thank God. Thank God. Phil? Phil?
Honey... Phil, where are you? Phil... Are you kidding me?! Not
the.... Phil! Phil!

Mitchell :I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Cameron : I'm a mob wife.
Mitchell :Okay, um... Pepper, This is a little embarrassing.
Pepper : I don't even want to hear it.
Mitchell :Cameron still has feelings for you.
Pepper : Go on.

Phil : Hey!
Claire : What happened to you? You disappeared for 20 minutes.
We just had to break ourselves out of that bathroom.
Phil : I am so happy to see you. Get in here.
Claire : Oh, no. No, no. Seriously, what happened?
Modern Family Season 2x03 page.8

Alex : Dad was incredible! He was running around here turning
the gas line, Cleaning up broken glass, And taking care of Luke
after he ran into a wall.

Manny : That makes no sense. Clouds are air. You'd fall right
through them.

Claire : What?

Manny : Mm, I don't like trampolines. They make me seasick.

Luke : I got scared because the cabinet didn't fall down.
Claire : Mm-hmm. Ohh. I'm sorry.

Gloria : Manny, stop worrying. Heaven is a beautiful place with
sunshine and rainbows and butterflies.

Phil : Well, don't worry about it.

Manny : Butterflies?!

Claire : No, I'm sorry. Oh... I was so nervous. I freaked out.

Gloria : Ay, no, no, no, no.

Phil : It's all right. It's all right. I think it was a little bit of a rough
morning.

Manny : Ahh!

Gloria : The clouds in heaven... they're like trampolines.

Gloria : I didn't say butterflies! Manny, there's no butterflies!

Claire : Yes.
Phil : Wasn't it?
Claire : Yes, it was.
Phil : I don't know about you guys, But I just want to relax and
put my feet up. At the Museum of Tolerance. Who's in?
Alex : I am!
Phil : You are. Okay. Let's do it.
Jay : There's nothing mystical about an earthquake. Pressure
builds, and it's released. And you just hope there's not too much
damage. But it makes you realize what matters. And for me, that's
my family.
Manny : I'll put in a good word for you.
Jay : You're the best, kid.
Jay : My family and golf.
Manny : What do you walk on?
Gloria : Ay, Manny, don't be ridiculous. The clouds.

Modern Family
2x04 : Strangers on a Treadmill

Jay : Gloria, do we have to keep this Colombia/Brazil soccer
game?
Gloria : Yes, I haven't seen it yet.

Luke : Oh, my God. That was so
Phil : I know, right?
Claire : What?
Luke : Dad just wrote another classic one. Tell her.
Phil : Oh! I don't know about "classic," but here we go. "If you're
looking for a two-story house, I'm your man. I'll tell you one story
before you buy it and then another story after."
Luke : No, you didn't!

Jay : It's been sitting in there for five months. I mean, I can tell you
who wins.
Gloria : Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!
Jay : And what about this two-hour "antiques roadshow"?
Manny : I'll watch it today.
Jay : Fine. I'm gonna play some golf.
Gloria : No. What about Mirabel's daughter's quinceanera?
Jay : I honestly didn't get any of that.
Gloria : Mirabel. She works for you.

Phil : Tonight is the S.C.A.R.B.

Jay : Okay.

Claire : The Southern California annual realtor's banquet.

Gloria : Her daughter, Rosalba, is celebrating her quinceanera,
Her 15th birthday. She invited us. You just going to ignore it.

Phil : I think they know what it is.
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Phil : It's the mother of all Residential-real-estate banquets. Now,
for the last five years, Gil Thorpe has hosted, But as luck would
have it, he's having a sketchy-looking polyp remove so they've
asked me to..."Phil in." see what I did?
Claire : Oh, yeah.
Phil : "Phil." you think I should open with that?
Claire : You betcha. You should.
Claire : Phil is gonna bomb. It's not that he's not fun. He is so fun.
He's just not funny. It's probably my fault, because I laugh at all of
his jokes, with my mouth... Not with my eyes.
Phil : "I see the great realtor Margaret Wilson is here, looking more
curvaceous than ever. Talk about your balloon payments."

Jay : Of course not. I get this all the time. I throw it on my
secretary's desk, And she sends them an Omaha steak.
Manny : Ay, Jay.
Jay : What?!
Gloria : Manny's right. The quinceanera is very important in the
latin culture. The moment the father dances with his little princess.
Ay, I remember my own father holding my hand. There wasn't a
dry eye in the cartel.
Jay : But these people don't want me there. See, they're just being
polite. I'm the boss.
Gloria : That's what you tell yourself so you can stay above them.
You just throw them an "Obama" steak and run to the golf course.
Jay : I'm not trying to stay above them. I just don't think I have to
go all "arriba, arriba" with them.
Manny : Because you're better than them?
Jay : No, of course not. I mean, I'm better than some of them.
Modern Family Season 2x04 page.1

Gloria : Do you even know these people, Jay, hmm? Or they're just
the backs you step on?

Claire : It's what?

Jay : I know you like to make me out as an elitist, But the truth is,
I'm close with these people.

Claire : I hate it when you do that.

Gloria : Then prove it. Just go to the party.

Mitchell : You never heard of troga?
Mitchell : What?

Jay : Fine. One hour. You drive. 'cause I don't want to give my
valet ticket to the wrong guy, Have you all over me.

Claire : "you've never heard of troga?" "you never tried octopus?"
"you never did this amazing thing I just discovered yesterday but I
pretend like I've done my whole life?"

Manny : Ay, Jay.

Mitchell : So, troga is treadmill yoga. It's de rigueur.

Jay : Where do you keep popping out from?!

Claire : It's de-dorky.

Mitchell : So, cam has started working out again, which is... it's...
it's great. He's feeling good about himself, and I want him to be
healthy, so it is all good. Except for one thing.

Mitchell : What is your deal today?

Cameron : Knock, knock.
Mitchell : Look who's there.
Mitchell : Maybe there's a person in this world Who looks good in
bike shorts, But my boyfriend is not that person. And I-I can't tell
him because he gets incredibly sensitive about even the tiniest
comment concerning his physique.
Cameron : Hey, I think I'm gonna take this spin class tomorrow
morning.
Mitchell : Oh, sure.
Cameron : Oh, I get it. Message received.
Mitchell : I didn't say anything!
[OPENING CREDITS]

Claire : I'm sorry. Phil is hosting that thing tonight, And... and he's
been writing jokes.
Mitchell : Ooh, yikes.
Claire : I know. And I'm worried he's gonna humiliate himself in
front of all those important people. I can't say anything because...
Mitchell : No, no. I get it. I get it. I get it. Because it would hurt
him even more coming from you.
Claire : Yeah.
Mitchell : You know, I'm kind of going through something similar
With cam right now.
Claire : Why?
Mitchell : He's started exercising again.
Claire : Well, that's good for him.
Mitchell : Yeah. He's wearing bike shorts.
Claire : That's bad for you.
Mitchell : And I'm the last person who can say anything, Because
he's...
Claire : yeah.

Claire : Okay, can't you just run like a normal person?

Mitchell : Okay, wait. No, no. All right. You know the movie
"Strangers on a train"?

Mitchell : What? It's troga.

Claire : Hm, I never saw it.
Modern Family Season 2x04 page.2

Mitchell : You've never seen "Strangers on a..." I'm sorry. Great
film. But it's these guys who both discover that they want
someone out of their lives.
Claire : Uh-huh.
Mitchell : So one of the guys proposes the perfect crime. They will
do each other's murders. We should do that.

Alex : I think I want to be popular.
Haley : Of course you do. You just can't be so obvious about it.
You've given MacKenzie way too much power, and you need to
take some of that power back. it's her.
Alex : Give me the phone.

Claire : All right, so I would tell Cam to lose the bike shorts?

Haley : Here's what you're gonna say... "Hey, MacKenzie. I'm busy.
Call me back later." Then you hang up.

Mitchell : Keeping me out of it. And I tell Phil to lose the jokes.

Alex : No way!

Claire : I like it. I'm in.

Haley : Then you're not getting the phone back.

Mitchell : All right!

Alex : Just give it to me.

Claire : I am in!

Haley : "Hey, MacKenzie. I'm busy. Call me back later." then you
hang up.

Alex : Hey, MacKenzie. 'sup? It's Alex. Hey, so I was thinking later
we'd... Oh, no. Whatever you want. Call me later! Or I'll call you
later, or...

Alex : I can't.

Haley : So, who's MacKenzie?

Haley : Do it!

Alex : You don't know her.

Alex : Okay! Damn you. Hey, MacKenzie. I'm busy. Call me back
later. That was hard.

Haley : Oh, I know MacKenzie. Cute. Popular. I am MacKenzie. I
invented MacKenzie. And the way she's making my sister run
around... it's... it's kind of funny, but... I can't have it. It's bad for
the family.
Haley : What are you doing?
Alex : I was about to call...
Haley : Mackenzie? Yeah, I know. Now shut up and let me help
you. The world is divided into two groups... Cool girls and girls
like you. And you have been given a rare opportunity to move
from the former to the latter.
Alex : The latter to the former.
Haley : Whatever. Oh, my god. You're such a geek. Now, do you
want to be smart, or do you want to be popular?

Haley : Do it!
Alex : No!

Haley : If it was easy, everyone would be popular.
Claire : Knock, knock !
Cameron : Come on in! It's open!
Claire : Hey! I just wanted to drop off these old baby clothes for
Lily.
Cameron : Oh, that's right. You're so sweet.
Claire : I hope I didn't come at a bad time.
Cameron : Not at all. I was just deciding where to take Lily for our
bike ride... the lake or the park. I'm leaning towards the park.
Claire : I can see that.
Phil : You didn't have to do that. You guys are a touch o' class.
Modern Family Season 2x04 page.3

Mitchell : Well, it is a big night for you, so, French.

Claire : Oh, great. Okay. Okay.

Luke : Those guys.

Cameron : You should probably just show yourself. I hear... I hear
some crying down the hallway.

Mitchell : So, have you given any thought to what you might say?
Phil : Oh, actually, I'm trying not to think about my act right now.
I'm kind of fighting the old butterflies, to be honest.
Luke : That's normal. I hear the Jonas brothers get scared before
every concert.
Phil : Not Kevin? The guy's a rock.
Luke : Especially Kevin.
Claire : I can't believe I ever bought this for Alex. I wish somebody
had said something.
Cameron : Oh, come on. That was probably cute 10 years ago.
Claire : No, no. It never was. And you know... I'm the exact same
way about my clothes. Most of the time, great. But every now and
again, there's that one outfit I just wish somebody would be
honest with me and say, "what you're wearing is in...Appropriate."
Do you know what I mean?

Claire : Look at that. That's a good dad. 'cause you've got a baby,
and you hear every little sound. I wouldn't have... I wouldn't have
even noticed... crying.
Phil : Uh, okay. all right. All you need to know about this one is
that skip woosnum is a well-known realtor and he's old.
Mitchell : Got it.
Phil : Skip woosnum. Realtor. Old. Here we go. I'm not saying
realtor skip woosnum is old, but the first property he ever sold...
was a cave.
Phil : You're not, uh... not laughing.
Luke : Why aren't you laughing, uncle Mitchell?
Phil : 'cause he doesn't think it's funny, Or maybe... maybe you
don't think I'm funny. Is that what you're saying, Mitch?
Mitchell : No, it's... I just got it! Oh. Cave!

Cameron : I think I do, Claire. I think I do.

Phil : That one's kind of a thinker.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Mitchell : Yes!

Cameron : And my answer is yes.
Claire : Okay.

Jay : There he is. All right, now.

Cameron : I would love to dress you.

Gloria : Knock it off, Jay. You don't know anyone's name here.

Claire : No, it... I don't want you to dress me. No. And...I owe it to
you to be honest, So I'm just gonna say that you need to lose the
bicycle shorts.

Jay : Are you kidding me? Carlos!

Cameron : Excuse me?
Claire : They're not working for you, Cam. Please don't take this
personally. I mean, nobody looks good in bike shorts. I just... I feel
that I owe it to you to be honest. So, we're good, right?
Cameron : We're great. We're great. We're great.

Gloria : Lucky guess.
Jay : I'm lucky only one turned around.
Jay : Listen... I need a favor. I overestimated the number of people
I know at this party. So you go around, introduce yourself, and I'll
hear the names.
Modern Family Season 2x04 page.4

Manny : You realize you're asking me to help prove my own
mother wrong.
Jay : I'll pay two bucks per introduction.
Manny : All right, well, that's Ramona. She's crazy for bingo.
Jay : Ramona.
[In Spanish]
Gloria : What's going on next door?
Barman : It's a Quinceanera.
Gloria : Another Quinceanera ?
Barman : This is not a Quinceanera. This is an engagement party.
Look.
Jay: Gloria! Stop being such a snob. Come over and meet my
friend Julio and his wife... Uh, I'm sorry. Your name again?
Old Woman : Qué?
Jay : I think you're really gonna hit it off with Kay!

Mitchell : Yes. Yes, go. This... this could get ugly. Hello, Claire. You
are a gutless weasel. Oh, yeah. No. I heard what you said to my
boyfriend.
Claire : You told Phil he was hysterical! You said he was this
generation's Richard Pryor!
Mitchell : Well, I am not the one that you need to apologize to.
What are you babbling about?
Claire : You owe me a murder.
Mitchell : Okay, Claire, I c... I couldn't do it. I couldn't crush Phil's
dreams.
Claire : We had a deal. I told Cam about the bike shorts.
Mitchell : No! No! The deal was to get Cam to take off the bike
shorts. But guess what... he is still in the stupid bike shorts. Can I
call you back? Turns out Cam was here the whole time, and he just
heard everything I said.
Claire : Ooh. Did he just run into the bedroom and cry?
Mitchell : Oh, yes, 'cause that's what all gay men do. We all
dissolve into... Yes. That is what he did.

Gloria : Mm-hmm.
Cameron : I mean, she's gonna tell me how to dress?! She ought to
stick to things she knows more about, like overcooking salmon.
Mitchell : Okay, wait. So, she actually said that you don't look
good in bicycle shorts?
Cameron : Yes.
Mitchell : "you don't look good in bicycle shorts."

Claire : There are challenging moments in every marriage.
Um...Having to tell your husband that he's not funny So that he
won't humiliate himself has to be one of the toughest. So I went a
different way.
Cameron : Stop talking. I just need some time for this wound to
become a scar.

Mitchell : Oh, and here she is.

Mitchell : I'm sorry I got Claire involved, But... and this is not a
criticism, But sometimes you can be a little sensitive about
your...Appearance.

Cameron : Okay, you know what? I can't be here. I'm... I'm going
out for some air.

Cameron : Well, this is a criticism... Sometimes you can be
insensitive about everything.

Cameron : Madness.

Modern Family Season 2x04 page.5

Mitchell : Oh, I-I just... Cam, I just feel like our relationship's
strong enough to survive a little candor. I mean, look, you could
tell me if there's something about me you'd like to change.
Cameron : I hate your beard.
Mitchell : Wow. Well, you had that bullet in the chamber.
Cameron : I never said anything because I never wanted to hurt
you... But I've always found your beard off-putting. See? Hurts.
Mitchell? Mitchell, get back here! What are you doing?
Mitchell : I'm shaving off the bear.
Cameron : Seriously?
Mitchell : Yeah, well, the man I love doesn't like it, so off it goes.
Cameron : Well, good.
Mitchell : Good.
Cameron : Great.
Mitchell : Great. Okay. one... Two... Three.
Cameron : Wait! The fact that you're willing to do it is enough for
me. I love your beard. I love that when you drink cappuccino, you
get foam in it and when you're nervous, your little... hairs twitch.

Alex : It's MacKenzie.
Haley : Again.
Alex : She wants me to come to this party she's throwing, she
texted me earlier.
Haley : You texted her back, right?
Alex : No.
Haley : Wow. I'm... Proud? Tell her you'll try and come.
Alex : Right.
Haley : And then when she says...
Alex : Haley... I got this. Hey. Who's this?
Haley : Brilliant.
Alex : No, I didn't see it. I get a lot of texts.
Haley : I have a sister.
Alex : When's the party? I'll try and come. You know, I'm kind of
busy. I have a life. You know, stuff. Homework.
Haley : Uh-oh.

Mitchell : Well, you couldn't have told me before took a notch
out?

Alex : I mean, not homework. It's not work if you love it.

Cameron : I'm sorry. I-I... listen. I know... I can be touchy about...
this. But you're this amazing-looking guy, and...

Alex : Shut up! Not you, MacKenzie.

Mitchell : I am not amazing... Really?

Alex : Um, I have to go. I-I'll call you later. or you call me later.
Love you! Aah!

Cameron : I wouldn't change anything.

Haley : Oh, god. Hang up. Hang up.
Haley : Drop the phone and kick it over here!

Mitchell : Oh... You should know that every day, I wake up very
grateful to have you in my life. I'm the one who got lucky,
handsome. Maybe I just don't show it enough.

Haley : Aah!

Cameron : Well, you can make it up to me by doing my shoulders.

Claire : I know, and we looked everywhere, honey, So just calm
down.

Mitchell : Sure.

Phil : They were right in here!

Cameron : I meant a massage. What are you saying? Oh, Mitchell.
Mitchell.
Modern Family Season 2x04 page.6

Phil : Are you kidding me? "Calm down"? In one minute, I'm
gonna be standing up there like... Like a... Oh, my god. I have no
material at all.
Claire : Okay. You're gonna be fine. You don't need jokes. Listen to
me, honey. Get up there. Be your charming self. Make the
introductions from your heart, and get out. You're gonna... you're
gonna be amazing, okay? Mwah!
Man : Phil Dunphy.
Claire : Go. Go.
Phil : Good evening. I would not be here tonight if not for the hard
work of the S.C.A.R.B. Board of trustees...
Phil : I didn't have my jokes. What choice does a guy have but to
play it straight?
Phil : ...The support of my family, and Gil Thorpe's colon. But Phil
Dunphy is no straight guy. So many giants of residential real estate
here tonight. And, of course, J.J. Mccubbin. I'm not saying J.J. is
small, but in the realty section, he was described as "charming."
Mark Simon, you out there? There's Mark. How are you, buddy?
Mark recently moved into a new model. How are you, Francine? I
kid, Mark Simon. I kid, Mark Simon. You know that.
Jay : Trancito, little Manuel, and Carlos, my wife, Gloria.
Gloria : Nice to meet you. We have to talk.
Jay : Un momento. You know, I... I can't believe you never met
them.
Gloria : You've never met any of these people. You don't know
anyone in this room. Vamos, Jay.
Jay : I'm not leaving before the father/daughter dance. And "these
people," as you call them, are not just employees. They're mi
familia, or "my family."

Gloria : I know what "mi familia" is, Jay.
Jay : Oh, I was afraid of this.
Man [in Spanish] : At this time, I would like to bring the future
groom to the dance.
Gloria No. Jay. No.
Jay: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. I'm gonna make this brief. I know a lot of
you out there don't even know who I am. As my lovely wife,
Gloria, pointed out, that's my fault, not yours. I'm Jay Pritchett, El
jefe. Listen... on this very, very happy occasion, I'd like to pick up
the tab on the bar. You know, when I started this company... ...The
first thing that I... What? Oh, right. Right, now. Good. Yeah. It is
not about me. This is about a very special young lady and the man
who loves her more than anyone else on earth. Isn't that lovely?
That's a beautiful, beautiful thing. You know, I'm reminded of
when I used to dance with my little girl. But not like that. Slow
down, there, muchacho. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no. What, are you applauding this? You're applauding this? I don't
care what kind of tradition this is. This is gonna stop. Hey, hey,
hey, hey. No! No! What? What? Am I the only one seeing this?!
Gloria: V-v-vamos!
Phil : I mean, honey, I am not kidding when I tell you there was a
woman next to me gasping for breath.
Claire : Seriously, you were so freaking funny, Phil. I have seen
professional comedians who could never have done that. You
were unbeliev...
Phil : I know it was you, Claire. You stole my index cards.
Claire : I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I thought I was protecting you. And
if my plan had been successful, I would have robbed you of the
greatest night ever. I'm sorry I'm awful.

Modern Family Season 2x04 page.7

Phil : You're not awful. Claire... I love that you're looking out for
me, and know why you worry about me. But I knew I had this
tonight. I know.
Claire : Sometimes I just think my job is to make sure you guys
don't fall on your faces.
Phil : That's a hard job in the Dunphy house. We fall a lot.
Claire : I know.
Phil : Maybe your real job is to be the person who picks us back
up. Nobody does that better than you.
Claire : Thank you. Alex.
Alex : I have no friends.
Phil : You're on the clock.
Claire : Mm. All right. What happened?
Luke: Oh, my gosh, mom. You're killing me.
Claire : It's pretty good, right?
Luke : Pretty good? You could be, like, in Vegas.
Phil : Well... W-w-what's going on there?
Luke : Mom does the funniest impression of that weird lady at the
supermarket.
Phil : Oh, yeah. I know her. Let's hear it.
Claire : Okay. Um... "It's cheaper if you buy two jars of pickles."
Luke : It's like she's right here!
Phil : I know! Yeah.
Phil : That's not what she sounds like.

2x05 : Unplugged

Cameron : Those skinny bitches.
Mitchell : We have got to get her into school, Cameron, Or else
she's gonna fall behind.

Manny : Mom. The dog again...

Cameron : Don't you think I know that?

Gloria : I know Papi, I want to strangle that crazy old thing.

Mitchell : Oh, this is perfect. Oh, leave it to the gays to raise the
only underachieving Asian in America.

Jay : Just ignore it.
Gloria : It's easy for you to ignore because you have the old-man
hearing. But Manny and I... we have the young ears.

Claire : Okay, here you go. Guys, breakfast. Guys. Phil. Hello.

Jay : I don't get how one dog keeps you awake when you grew up
sleeping through cockfights and revolutions.

Phil : Totally with you. Kids, put your dishes in the dishwasher.

Gloria : Mm-hmm. Very funny, Jay. Manny hasn't been able to
sleep in weeks. It's screwing his brain for school. And it doesn't
stop. It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
on and on.

Haley : Why are you freaking out?

Jay : Yes, that could be annoying.

Phil : Oh, I'm locking in my fantasy roster. I'm unbeatable. We're
totally getting an aboveground pool.

Gloria : That's it. I'm going over there.
Jay : Gloria, now, don't go starting something. Because whenever
you do, I'm the one that... that, she couldn't hear.

Claire : Okay, no. That's it. Everybody, gadgets down now!
Claire : Because you're all so involved with your little gizmos,
Nobody is even talking. Families are supposed to talk. What are
you doing that's so important?

Luke : Die, stupid, die!
Claire : Luke, I told you to put that down now. Come on, buddy.
Luke : One second. I'm about to beat dad's record.

Mitchell : They're gone. Cam. All the children are gone.

Phil : You heard your mother.

Cameron : What children?

Claire ; What is so funny?

Mitchell : I was running in the park, and I noticed that none of the
kids Lily usually plays with were there.

Alex : Nothing. "mom's insane."

Cameron : Well, it's still early.
Mitchell : But then I ran into Lori.
Cameron : Boobs Lori or adult-braces Lori?
Mitchell : Great-shoes Lori.
Cameron : Oh, I like her.
Mitchell : And she said that they all sent their kids to preschool.
Cameron : What?! We agreed to wait till next year.

Claire : Thank you, Haley.
Haley : At least we talk.
Claire : Hello.
Mitchell : Hey, it's me. What's a good preschool?
Claire : Uh, well, our kids went to Wagon Wheel.
Mitchell : And it was good? You liked it?

Mitchell : It was a fake-out to make sure that their kids got a spot.
Modern Family Season 2x05 page.1

Claire : Oh, well, you know my kids are middle-management
material at best. Didn't want to waste a lot of money... Yes,
Mitchell, it's good. Why the interest?
Mitchell : I just realized that all of Lily's friends are going to
school this year, and now she's late.
Claire : Don't worry. She can wait another year. Just buy her a
Blackberry, that's all she's gonna want to do anyway.
Cameron : What did she say?
Mitchell : She says to buy her a Blackberry.
Cameron : Lily doesn't have the dexterity for that, Claire!
Claire : What is happening?
Mitchell : Can you just check with your school and see if maybe
you can get us in?
Claire : Hmm. I-I can probably get you an interview.
Mitchell : Oh, no. That's great. That's great. Thank you. I really
appreciate it. Oh, and, by the way, what do you think of that place
Billingsley academy?
Claire : Ooh. Billingsley. Very hoity-toity. You can't get in there
unless you're really rich or you know somebody on the board.
Mitchell : Oh, god, this is a nightmare.
Claire : Mitch, it's preschool. Don't overthink it. My kids didn't go
to Billingsley, and they are fine. I have to go. Phil. that's awesome.

Gloria : Your dog doesn't stop barking. All morning, all night. He
wakes my son up, and he needs his sleep.
Larry : It's not my dog. It's my soon-to-be ex-wife's. She moved
out three weeks ago.
Jay : Is she coming back for it?
Larry : Not unless it starts crapping money.
Gloria : Well, you need to do something about the dog.
Larry : The dog is old and stupid.
Manny : Who are you really mad at, Larry? The dog or your wife?
Larry : Who the hell is this kid?
Jay : Hey, there's no need for that.
Gloria : I'll tell you who he is. His name is "shut up your damn
dog"!
Larry : You know what's ironic? You come over here complaining,
and I have never once said a word about that obnoxious parrot of
yours that's always squawking.
Jay : Parrot?
Gloria : What parrot?
Gloria : Jay! Jay! Jay!
Gloria : What is he talking about? What parrot?

game. Whoever stays unplugged the longest, wins.

duckies.
Mitchell : I know.
Cameron : I'm gonna mention that.

Modern Family Season 2x05 page.3

Mitchell : Okay, well, do, because that's really gonna set her apart
from the rest of the kids.
Cameron : Oh. We should also mention how she always perks up
when we watch "Charlie Rose."

Jay : I'll tell...
Gloria : How dare you? You come to our house, you ring our bell
many times, and you accuse us of taking your dog.
Jay : You should go home.

Mitchell : That was one time. He was interviewing Elmo.

Larry : We're not done here.

Secretary : You boys ought to relax.

Jay : Yes, we are. What did you do?

Mitchell : Oh, I'm sorry. We just... we really want to make a good
impression.

Secretary : Mm. Gay adoptive parents with a minority baby?
Sugars, you can get into any school you want.
Mitchell : Really?
Secretary : Oh, you didn't know that? oh, yeah. All of these
schools like to brag about their diversity. You're diverse times

Cameron : I hear that, girl.
Secretary : Yeah.
Jay : I'm coming!
Larry : Where the hell is the dog?
Gloria : Who is it?
Jay : It's our neighbor.
Larry : The dog is gone.
Jay : Maybe it ran away.
Larry : It was chained to a tree.
Gloria : Maybe your wife took it.
Larry : According to my credit card, my wife is in Europe,
searching for the world's most expensive hotel.
Jay : Then what do you want from us?
Larry : You come over complaining about the dog and the next
day it's gone? You tell me.

Jay : Gloria's grandfather and uncles were butchers, so she's
always had a certain comfort level when it comes to...Killing. One
time, we had this rat...
Gloria : What? First you smash it, then you cut the head off.
Jay : It was like nothing to her.
Gloria : I go to church now.
Jay : She left the head out there to send a message to the other rats.
Phil : Hey.
Claire : Hi, honey. How was your day at work?
Phil : Amazing.
Claire : Mwah. Great. What happened?
Phil : Instead of wasting my lunch hour surfing the web, checking
football stats, I put on some mellow music, And I meditated.
Claire : Wow. For how long?
Phil : I have no idea. I just woke up 20 minutes ago.
Haley : Hey, mom. I need a bar of soap and a black marker for an
art project.
Modern Family Season 2x05 page.4

Claire : Okay. Well, the marker's over there, And the soap is under
the sink. Isn't it great how much time you have now that you're
not wasting it online?

Alex : Really? What's the difference between a gamete and a
zygote?

Haley : Oh, my god. Is this what you always sound like?

Claire : Huh.

Luke : Look what I built, dad. Dunphy towers. 200 condos, a
happy family in every one.

Alex : That's it. I need the internet. I'm out of your stupid contest.

Phil : Way to go, buddy. I got to hand it to you, honey. 24 hours
without video games, He's already contributing to society.

Phil : She's kind of scary.

Luke : Die! Die!
Claire : To be fair, he's using his imagination.
Luke : There's no fire escapes! They cut corners! I'll cut your
corners!

Phil : Don't fall for it, Claire. She's just making up words.

Haley : Hmm. And then there were three.
Claire : We're not buying her a car.
Jay : Hey, buddy, what you reading?
Manny : "The old man and the sea."

Claire : Hello? Oh, hi. Luke, honey, it's for you. Hi, Griffin. How
are you? Yeah, he's right here. Hold on.

Jay : You like it?

Luke : Hey, Griffin. Oh, my god!

Jay : You read a lot of his stuff.

Claire : What happened?

Manny : That was a hint, Jay.

Luke : There's a parasailing-donkey video on Youtube.

Jay : Oh. Oh, okay. I want to ask you something... between you
and me.

Phil : Oh, my god!
Claire : Wait, Luke. What about the contest?
Luke : I quit. I'm not made of stone, you know.
Alex : Uhh! I can't believe it. I got a "b" on my paper.
Phil : Good for you.
Claire : Yeah.
Alex : No, it would be good for you. It's terrible for me. Thanks to
your moldy encyclopedias, my take on mitosis was completely out
of date. They don't even call it protoplasm anymore. It's
cytoplasm.
Claire : Well, you could have asked one of us.
Alex : Now you're making jokes?
Claire : I'm not making a joke.

Manny : I like that Hemingway gets to the point.

Manny : You want to know if I think my mom did something to
that dog.
Jay : Yeah.
Manny : Sit.
Jay : Don't most kids drink soda?
Manny : Who knows what they do?
Gloria : So, your mom.
Manny : Jay, I've learned a few things in my 12 years. Don't skimp
on linens, don't compliment a teacher on her figure, And when it
comes to my mom, never ask questions I don't want the answers
to.
Jay : I don't buy it. Sensitive kid like you. I think you want to
know every bit as much as I do.
Manny : You're wrong.
Modern Family Season 2x05 page.5

Jay : Then why is your hand shaking?

Cameron : What did you do?

Manny : This is my fifth one of these today. I may have a problem.

Mitchell : What's best for Lily.

Jay : Okay. That's enough.

Cameron : Did you?

Mitchell : No, no, no, 4:00 tomorrow is fine. Yeah, my life partner
and I will see you then. Thank... thank you.

Mitchell : Cam, this is the first time that being gay is a competitive
advantage. They're choosing teams for gym class, And we're
finally getting picked first.

Cameron : Since when do you call me your life partner?
Mitchell : Since a spot opened up at Billingsley academy.
Cameron : But I liked Wagon Wheel. It had all the duckies. And it
reminded me of where I went in Missouri.
Mitchell : Cam, everyone goes to Billingsley for a reason... It's the
Harvard of preschools.
Cameron : She's not even 2 years old yet. She doesn't need the
Harvard of preschools. She needs finger painting and duckies.

Cameron : I always got picked first. I could throw a dodgeball
through a piece of plywood. But I see your point.
Jay : Hey. Don't sneak up on me like that. What are you doing out
here?
Manny : You got in my head about my mom. Is that the rat
shovel?
Jay : Yeah.

Mitchell : I'm begging you to please just say "ducks." Hello?

Manny : Are you checking it for signs of dog?

Claire : Great news. Wagon Wheel loved you. You're in.

Jay : I was going to.

Mitchell : Oh. Wagon wheel wants us.

Manny : Well, let's do this quick. If she catches us, we're as dead as
that dog probably is.

Cameron : Oh, yes!
Mitchell : Okay. Well, that's great and everything, but actually we
have an appointment tomorrow at Billingsley.
Claire : Really?
Mitchell : Yeah, apparently we are in very high demand.
Claire : Oh, well, just so you know, I don't think Wagon Wheel is
gonna hold a place for you.

Gloria : What are you doing here?
Nothing.
Gloria : Why are you looking at that shovel? Do you think
someone did something with that shovel, Manny?
Manny : He thinks you killed the dog.
Jay : You little rat.

Mitchell : Well, I think we're gonna take our chance.

Manny : Don't call me a rat! She kills rats!

Claire : Take our chance? That sounds chancy. You know, Mitchell,
you were the one who called me in a panic. You were the one who
needed me to get you in.

Gloria : You really think that I would kill a dog?

Mitchell : I'm sorry, Claire. I didn't mean to put you out. But let's
not get too dramatic here. You wrote an e-mail.

Gloria : I don't know. How about I didn't kill a dog?

Claire : It wasn't an e-mail. It was a phone call from a land line.

Jay : Well, what was I supposed to think?
Jay : Just tell me what you did with it.
Gloria : He's in a better place.
Modern Family Season 2x05 page.6

Jay : That's what people say when something's dead.
Gloria : Okay, fine. I took him to a farm where he has plenty of
room to run.

Haley : Please stop. You're just embarrassing yourself. Well, it
looks like it's just you and me, old man.
Phil : Bring it.

Jay : That's the second thing people say when something's dead.
Gloria : My hairdresser's brother has three kids. They live in the
country. They were so happy to have the dog that they gave me a
jar of pickles. Is that also what they say when something is dead?

Secretary : And finally, here we are back at the office. If you two
would like to take a seat, I will let Mr. Plympton know that you're
here.

Jay : Really?

Mitchell : Thank you.

Gloria : Look. Look how happy they are, Instead of him being tied
to a tree outside With no one to talk to.

Cameron : Yes, thank you. This place is amazing!

Jay : Why didn't you just tell me this in the first place?

Cameron : It's like Hogwarts!

Gloria : Like you would be okay with me stealing a dog?

Mitchell : The ladybug sanctuary.

Jay : No.

Cameron : Oh, my gosh. The little cobblestones.

Gloria : Exactly. That's why I didn't tell you. Now the dog is
happy, Manny can sleep, and we have pickles.

Mitchell : So sweet. I know.

Jay : Okay, it worked out this time, But don't forget that stealing is
against the law. Now, maybe in Colombia...
Gloria : Ah, here we go, Because in Colombia we trip over goats
and we kill people in the street. Do you know how offensive that
is? Like we are Peruvians!

Mitchell : I told you.

Cameron : Screw the duckies. We belong here. Do you think
they're gonna let us in?
Mitchell : Cam, relax. We're queer, we're here.
Cameron : Yes, we are.
Secretary : Okay. Just a few more minutes.
Cameron : Thank you.

Claire : The contest was hard. Reservations. Even though we had
sworn off the internet, The rest of the world hadn't.

Mitchell : Yes, thank you.

Claire : Orlando. Domestic. Representative. Representative!
Representative!

Secretary : Wonderful. These two are first. You'll be next.

Computer voice : You've got mail.
Phil : Really, Claire?

Cameron : So what? Lily's Asian. We're gay. In the school
admissions poker game, we're the winning hand.

Claire : You don't understand. I was trying to deal with our plane
tickets to visit your family.

Kavita : Hi. Nice to meet you.

Stephanie : Hi. I'm Stephanie Kaner. And this is Javar. We have an
interview with Mr. Plympton.
Mitchell : Single white mother, black child.

Stephanie : Oh, honey, sorry. My partner Kavita.
Secretary : Hello. Nice to meet you. It will be just a few minutes.
Modern Family Season 2x05 page.7

Cameron : Disabled interracial lesbians with an African kicker.

Phil : I knew it. I knew you couldn't do it. I told you I'd outlast
them.

Mitchell : Did not see that coming.

Haley : This sucks!
Alex : What's going on?

Phil : It's been a while since I read an actual newspaper. Missed
that sound. No, no, no, no!

Phil : I'll tell you what's going on. I win. Nobody gets a car, I
dump Tom Brady, and our long Amish nightmare is over.

Claire : What is it?

Claire : I can't believe you thought You were gonna put one over
on us.

Phil : Brady's injured. No! He's my whole team. I have to change
my roster.

Haley : I can't believe That he's actually already on the internet.

Claire : Honey, if you can't do it over the phone, You can't do it,
because we're not buying Haley a car.

Phil : Believe it, girl.

Phil : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well... Well, I'm just gonna go to the
bathroom.

Phil : Yep.

Claire : Phil Dunphy, don't you even dream of it.

Phil : What?

Phil : Claire, all my friends are in that league. I'm gonna look like
an idiot.

Claire : What?

Haley : So, you're actually online right now?
Haley : Well, then I hate to break it to you, daddy, but you lose.

Claire : So what?

Haley : This isn't my phone. I carved it out of a bar of soap and
colored it in with a marker.

Phil : So I paid a huge entrance fee.

Claire : Phil, she carved a telephone out of a bar of soap.

Claire : How huge?

Haley : I can't believe it! I'm getting a car!

Phil : Not huge. Tiny. Oh, my goodness. How is she not cracking
up there? Listen to her.

Phil : Holy crap, we've been Shawshanked.

Haley : No, I know, but do you know?
Claire : Wait a minute. She's alone.

Mr. Plympton : Sorry about the delay. I was going over the plans
for our new dance studio.

Phil : So?

Cameron : Wow.

Claire : She's alone.

Mr. Plympton : So, tell me about yourselves.

Phil : Oh, my god.

Mitchell : Uh, well, I'm a lawyer.

Haley : I know. You should see her pants. I'll text it to you. Oh,
wait. Okay. Hold on. I'll send it.

Mr. Plympton : Many of our applicants are attorneys.

Modern Family Season 2x05 page.8

Cameron : While my white-man name is Tucker, I am 1/16
Cherokee. Ready for child to soar like eagle.
Mitchell : Oh, god.

Jay : I've been thinking if you said as much about America as I
said about Colombia, I'd be plenty ticked off. Doesn't make up for
everything, but...
Gloria : A trip to Colombia?

Haley : So, what are you saying?
Claire : You're not getting a car.
Haley : But I won.
Phil : Yes, but we never thought you would.
Haley : So?
Claire : So, congratulations on your victory. Nobody can ever take
that away from you.
Phil : So true.
Haley : But I spent two days in my room talking to a bar of soap.
It's not fair.
Phil : It's totally not fair.
Claire : We're outraged.
Phil : Bad parenting.

Jay : I want to see your village, learn your culture. I love you. I'm
sure I'm gonna love where you come from.
Gloria : Aw, Jay. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Gloria : No way he's going to my village. I was in a car accidents
when I was living there. Both times I hit a goat. One was hurt
pretty bad. But it was a good thing I had a shovel in the trunk.
Cameron : That, though I layretold with fire-haired man, The
giving hawk would bring us baby with her skin the color of sweet
corn, which my people call maize.
Mitchell : Please stop.
Mr. Plympton : Well, um...

Haley : But we had a deal.

Cameron : Knowledge is her sustenance, like so much maize...
which, you'll remember, means "corn.

Phil : Which, in hindsight, was utter nonsense.

Mitchell : What if I was a single dad?

Claire : Hey.
Mitchell : We hated Billingsley.
Cameron : The place is so stupid.
Claire : Ugh! You blew the interview, didn't you?
Mitchell : Lesbians.
Cameron : In a wheelchair.
Claire : Oh.
Jay : You still mad at me?
Gloria : You tell me. What is this?

Modern Family
2x06 : Halloween
Claire : Hi, honey. Breakfast will be ready in a minute.
Luke : Hi.
Claire : Aaaaaaaaah! My ha-a-a-nd! Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Luke : Very funny, mom. I know it's Halloween. Nice fake hand.
Phil: Aaaah! Aaaah!
Luke : Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Phil : Ha ha ha!

Dale: Um, right now I'm thinking either vampire or werewolf.
Every year it's harder to decide.
Mitchell : Wait, wait, wait. I-I'm sorry. Wait. So people really come
to work in costumes here?
Lance : Are you kidding? It's epic, bro!
Dale : Epic.
Mitchell : Ohh.
Mitchell: I'm already the new guy. I don't want to be the nonpartipation guy, too.

Claire : Ha ha!

Cameron :Not on my watch. Unfortunately, Halloween was
marred for me personally by an incident long ago. Now it's just a
day I have to get through.

Phil : We love Halloween. Especially Claire.

Mitchell : So you've said.

Claire : It's my favorite holiday. Ever since I was a kid, I loved
scary things. If there was a new horror movie in town, I was the
first in line. "one, please." Then I met Phil.

Claire : All right, so, everybody has to be here at 5:30 to rehearse
our house of horrors. You guys have your costumes ready?

Phil : "two, please."
[OPENING CREDITS]

Luke : Yeah, but it's a secret. Me and Manny came up with
something together.
Claire : I love that!
Luke : Can I have some candy?

Mitchell : Okay. All right. Do me.

Claire : No. How 'bout you, Alex?

Cameron : ♪ do me, do me, do me ♪

Alex :Well, I haven't really thought about it. I've got, like, three
huge exams tomorrow.

Mitchell : Cam, I have to say, I feel kind of sexy. Well, squeaky
sexy, but...
Cameron : You know I'd be enjoying this more If Halloween
wasn't such a tough day for me. But I want you to go to work...
and knock their socks off.
Mitchell : Well, my last job was at a pretty conservative law firm.
No one there would ever dress up for Halloween. But apparently
at this new company...

Claire : Honey, you can't just slap something together at the last
minute. You know, if you gave this costume half as much time and
attention as you give your homework, you wouldn't be in this
situation.
Alex :Can I remind you, you have one child who's not mediocre?
Haley : Check it. I'm a scary black cat.
Claire : The only person that costume scares is me. Go change it.
Modern Family Season 2x06 page.1

Haley : To what?

Jay : I know less now than I did before I asked.

Claire : I don't know. One of your old costumes. Honey, trust me. I
am sparing you an entire day of guys asking you if you have a
rough tongue. Ew.

Gloria : Hmm. A bruja is a witch, and a gargle is a gargle.

Jay : Hello.
Claire : Hi. Dad. It's me. I wanted to make sure you and Gloria
were ready for tonight.
Jay : What's tonight?
Claire : What do you mean, what is tonight? Dad, it's Halloween.
You know this.
Jay : Calm down, Morticia, I'm just teasing you. We'll be there.
Claire : Yeah, but in costume this time. You can't just show up with
a backwards baseball cap and call yourself Snoop Dogg like you
did last year.
Jay : I didn't even know who that guy was. Haley turned my hat
around and told me to say it. I thought he was a dog detective.
Listen, don't worry. We got the whole thing worked out. Bye-bye.
Gloria : Hola, Jay!
Jay : Where are you?
Gloria : I have Manny in the carpool, And we're going to the
dropout.
Jay : Dropout? You mean that Eddie kid? Yeah, he's a moron.
Gloria : No, the dropout, where you drop the kids in the school.
Manny : She means "drop-off."
Gloria : That's what I said.
Jay : Listen, did you ever do anything about costumes for Claire's
thing tonight?

Manny : She means "gargoyle."
Gloria : That's what I said.
Jay: As long as you got it covered. Because if Claire doesn't get her
Halloween, She turns into a real "rhymes with 'bruja.'"
Mitchell : Oh, no. No, no, no. I'm the only one. Ohh.
Dale : At lunch, I'll let you wear my fangs.
Lance : Yeah?
Dale : Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Lawyer #1 : Whoo! Look at those tools.
Lawyer #2 : Every year. What a couple of douches.
Mitchell : Ohh. Oh, no.
Cameron : Hello?
Mitchell : There are exactly three people in costume here... A tool,
a douche, and me. And I don't have time to go home and change
and...
Cameron : Calm down. Did you bring in the dry-cleaning from
last night?
Mitchell : Are you really getting on me about the dry-cleaning
wh... Oh. I have suits in the trunk.
Cameron : Look at that. Yesterday's lazy cures today'crazy.
Mitchell : Yes. Thank you! Thank you. Okay.
Charlie : Oh, there you are.
Mitchell : Hey, Charlie.

I'm going to pick them up this afternoon.

Charlie : Hey, I need you in the Lampkin meeting. If I could just
maybe have... Five minutes.

Gloria : You're going to be a "gargle," And I'm gonna be an evil
village bruja.

Charlie : First legal question.

Mitchell : O-kay. Okay, hey.

Modern Family Season 2x06 page.2

Mitchell : Yeah?

Claire : Oh, yeah. She was so unhappy. How's he doing?

Charlie : Can I fire those idiots for no reason? Oh, my gosh. Those
are some major guns you got there.

Phil : He's not taking it as well as you are.

Mitchell : Eh, yeah.

Claire : Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I don't mean to be insensitive. I've
just got a lot to get done.

Phil : Why won't this... hey, Jerry.

Phil : I don't find you insensitive. I find you delightful. Do you
find me delightful?

Jerry : Hey, Phil. Looking good.
Phil : Thanks. Wait till you see what we got planned for tonight.
Claire and I are going as corpse bride and groom. As if there's any
other kind, am I right? I'm saying marriage kills you.
Jerry : Judy left me.
Phil : Oh, my god. I am so sorry.
Phil : When someone your age dies, What's the first thing you
want to know? "died of what?" right? You want to hear it was
something That could never happen to you. Well, it's the same
with divorce. Tell me it was booze, cheating, physical abuse. No
problem. I'm a monogamous social drinker, And Claire only sleephits me. Just don't tell me it came from out of the blue.

Claire : Oh, god, I just remembered! Jerry's supposed to be our
porch scarecrow. Can you ask him if he'll still do it?
Phil : He's kind of a mess right now.
Claire : Yeah, but it might make him feel better be around people.
Phil : I'll try... But his whole world just turned upside down. Can
you imagine? One minute, you're happily married, the next
minute, you're completely by yourself.
Lawyer #3 : I don't need excuses. I need this lawsuit to go away.
Now, who's responsible for the keith deposition?
Dale: uh, well, I was, "shir." But, uh, in my defense, I "wash" told...
Lawyer #3 : Take those stupid fangs out, Dale. For starters, it's
daytime. Vampires sleep during the day... which you may soon
have plenty of time for.

Jerry : I was totally blindsided. I guess somewhere along the way
she stopped finding me delightful.

Dale : I'm sorry, but I was told that we didn't need Keith.

Phil : Well, that's - that's coconuts. You're super delightful.

Mitchell : I-I-I may have. I may have done that, sir.

Jerry : Not to Judy. She used to laugh at everything I had to say,
but now I can't even remember what her laugh sounds like.

Lawyer #3 : Well, that's disappointing. But at least Mitchell's new
here. Twilight, you're not. So get it done. Meeting adjourned.

Phil : Claire can do it. It's uncan...

Charlie : Clive's waiting for us in my office. We're already late.
Let's roll. Ah, you've really been hitting the gym. Yeah.

Jerry : I should go back inside. I have a dish to wash.
Phil : Okay, but, hey... Jerry, if you need anything, all right? I'm
your rock.
Phil : You are not gonna believe this. Judy just left Jerry.

Lawyer #3 : Who told you that?

Lawyer #3 : What the hell is that noise?
Mitchell : Every time I tried to get out of that costume, I got
dragged into another meeting. It was the worst Halloween ever.
Modern Family Season 2x06 page.3

Cameron : Really, Mitchell? The worst Halloween ever? You had
squeaky thighs. I lost a childhood.

Jay : It's not "volumptuous."

Gloria : Jay! This came for you.

Jay : What the hell is this?

Jay : Oh. Hi, honey. What is it?

Gloria : I told you, Jay, I called your secretary and told her to order
you a box of baby cheeses! Oh! So now it's my fault too!

Gloria : I called your secretary and told her to order you some
crackers and those cheeses that you like... the tiny, little ones.
Jay : Thanks. Did you pick up my "gargle" costume, too?
Gloria : Are you making fun of me?
Jay : No.
Gloria : First, Manny correcting me. And now you? If I have a
problem, I want to know, Jay.
Jay : Honey, look, English is your second language. You're doing
great.
Gloria : Yeah, you're not helping by protecting my feelings. I want
you to be honest with me.
Jay : Okay, well, I may have noticed some tiny, little mistakes You
might want to te a look at.

Gloria : Okay, enough. I know that I have an accent. But people
understand me just fine!

Jerry : Oh, yeah, can you tell Claire that I'm not really up for being
the scarecrow? Judy and I used to love Halloween. It's her favorite
holiday.
Phil : Huh.
Jerry : You know?
Phil : Gosh, I hate to think of you sitting in there alone, Running
through all this in your head. What could you have done
differently? What could you have done differently?
Jerry : It's actually a little hard for me to talk about.
Phil : Don't push me away. I'm not Judy.

Gloria : Like what?

Jerry : I could've been more spontaneous. Uh-huh. I-I-I could've
tried to have been more fun and sexy like I was in the old days.

Jay : Just little mispronunciations. Like, for example... Last night,
you said, "we live in a doggy-dog world."

Phil : Spontaneous and sexy. I got it. Yep. And remember, I'm here
for you, okay? Ohh! Son of a...

Gloria : So?
Jay : Well, it's "dog-eat-dog world."

Claire : What the hell is that?!

Gloria : Yeah, but... That doesn't make any sense. Who wants to
live in a world where dogs eat each other? A doggy-dog world is a
beautiful world Full of little puppies! What else do I say wrong?

Haley : What? You told me to put on an old costume.

Jay : Well, it's not "blessings in the skies." It's "blessings in
disguise."

Phil : Jerry is a no-go on the crow.

Gloria : What else?
Jay : "carpal tunnel syndrome" Is not "carpool tunnel syndrome."

Phil : Yeah, he was venting. I couldn't break free. God... You are
sexy.

Gloria : And what else?

Claire : Honey...

Claire : Not from when you were 8. Are you trying to get candy or
Japanese businessmen? Change it. Go.
Claire : You've been over there this whole time?

Modern Family Season 2x06 page.4

Phil : Not so fast. I don't think we're... It's okay.
Claire : I need to get down.
Phil : Oh, we can get down. We can get way down.
Claire : Oh, god! Phil!
Mitchell : No! No, no, no, no, no! No! Okay. Oh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Focus, Mitchell. Focus. Focus.
Cameron : Hello?
Mitchell : I'm trapped in a men's room, And all I have on is the
spider-man suit.
Cameron : Hot. Who is this?
Mitchell : Somebody took my shirt, and all the rest Of my clothes
are all "toilety." I'm screwed.
Cameron : Why don't you just tell Charlie the truth?
Mitchell : I can't. I already messed up once today. And I can't risk
it. I-I have another suit in my trunk, But I can't get to the car
without going through the office.

Claire ! Okay. You know what? Here. Here we go. Here you go.
Let's just cover you up. All right, now, I just want to run through

Claire : Right, and then dad does The thunder and the lightning
and the fog. Usher the children in past Alex her cage.
Alex :I'm in a cage?
Claire : Yes! You're in a house of horrors being held against your
will.
Alex :I know, so why do we need the cage?
Claire : And then Gloria pops up as the evil village bruja, and she
says... "welcome to your nightmare. Ah ha ha ha ha!" and the Cam
and Haley do their thing. Kids get their candy. They are ushered
out. They think it's all over, but it's not! Because out on the porch,
the scarecrow pops to life... Wow! ... for one final "aah!" And
that's... Mitchell, you're the scarecrow!
Mitchell : Oh, no, no. I was in a costume all day. It was awful.

Cameron : You know what's ironic? Who could really help you
right now is spider-man.

Cameron : It's nothing compared to when I was...

Mitchell : He's here. Ugh! Ooh! Okay. Okay. Okay. No, no, no, no,
no, no. no, no, no.

Cameron : Don't I?

Luke : Behold, my creation! Monster, do my bidding!
Manny : I do as you command, master.
Claire : So cute.
Haley : Okay. Mom. You cannot have a problem with this. I'm
Mother Teresa.
Claire : Are you kidding me?
Haley : What? I'm her back when she was hot.
Claire : I will pay you $10 to go put on more clothes.
Alex :Bet it's the first time you ever heard that one.

Mitchell : You don't own bad Halloweens.
Claire : Okay. We get it, Cam. Hard day. Mitchell, please. The
costume's in the kitchen. Come on.
Mitchell : Ohh. uh, Claire, Claire.
Phil : Before you go, I just want you to know...

Claire : That's nice.
Phil : You're my best friend!
Jay : Hey, guys.
Phil : Hey. Wow. God, you guys look great.

Gloria : Thank you, Phil. I try my best. You look very dead-like.

Phil : Come in...If you dare.

Jay : Gloria, stop it. I said I was sorry.

Claire : Dad.

Gloria : Oh, no, no, Jay. For now on, I only speak in proper

Phil : Did she just get back from the dentist?

Claire : No, no, no. First the thunder and the lightning!

Jay : She's mad at me because I told her Sometimes people can't
understand her.

Jay : Yeah, right. I got it.

Phil : Make it right, Jay. We're all just hanging by a thread.
Claire : Hey! Dad! Oh, you look great! Oh, good. Okay, Gloria's in
position. Hi, Gloria. There you go. Right back here.
Cameron : Claire, I don't know that I'm... I'm feeling up to this.
Claire : Why, Cam? Why? What happened that is so awful you
simultaneously can't speak of it and yet can't stop talking about it?
Cameron : I can't. It's too emotional.
Claire : Okay. Some other time.
Cameron : I was 10.
Mitchell : Oh, god.
Cameron : Dressed as Quasimodo on a front porch With my best
friend, Timmy Reglar, a ghostbuster. There was a bucket of candy
with a sign. It said "take one." one. Timmy took the entire bucket
and put it in his bag. Timmy didn't play by the rules. It's what I
liked and feared about him.
Claire : Oh.
Cameron : Then the bag broke as a crowd of kids rounded the
corner, saw the pile of candy. Timmy said, "Cam did it!"
Kids : Trick or treat?
Claire ; Oh, good. Aren't you glad you got that out? Okay,
everybody, our first victims! This is not a rehearsal. You ready?
You ready?

Phil : Thank you for joining us on our sp...

Claire : Perfect.

Gloria : Welcome to your nightmare. Ha ha ha ha!
Claire : What the hell is that?
Girl : Can, uh - can we just get our candy?
Haley : Okay. But with all the fog, you may not be able to see...

Cameron : Boo. Timmy started running. I wanted to run too but
got stuck on a rose bush and that's when I fell. I fell hard!
Girl : We can see his feet.
Claire : Okay... Here, here! Have some candy. Happy Halloween.
Okay, that was bad. That was a bad start. First of all, Dad, thunder,
lightning, fog, cue. And we skipped Alex altogether. And... Gloria,
since when do you speak English?

Like father, like daughter, in this "dog eat dog" family...

fallen in love. Now, I'll give you a guess who that guy is.

Claire : Other children haven't fared so well...
Alex :Ow, help me, help me...

Mitchell: Aw, my dad was...

Gloria : Welcome to your nightmare, oh, oh, oh!

Gloria : Aah!

Haley : But with all the fog, you may not be able to see... "ahead."

Cameron : You know what? I'm just gonna go.
Claire : No. Come on, Cam.

Boy : This place is weird. Let's go.

Alex :Uh, if uncle cam is leaving, I'm just gonna go upstairs and
study.

Phil : Mother of god. Ohh! Son of a...

Haley : Yeah, I have a party to go to, so...

Claire : What is wrong with everyone?! Cam, "townspeople"?
Really?

Mitchell : Ohh! She punched me in the face!

Cameron : I lived on a farm. They lived in town. They were the
townspeople.

Gloria : He came out of nowhere, and he scared the baby "cheeses"
out of me!
Jay : Hey, you're talking normal again.

Claire : And, dad! Dad! It goes - lightning, thunder, fog cue!

Gloria : Oh, I loved the story about the old man.

Jay : This whole thing is a colossal fog cue.

Jay : Well, nobody said "old."

Gloria : Claire just doesn't understand, Cam. Maybe she's never
been picked on for being different.

Mitchell : Oh, Cam, can we please just go?

Claire : When, Gloria? When have you ever been picked on for
"being different"?

Claire : Yeah, go, please. I don't care.

Gloria : Ask the "gargle."
Claire : what did she say?
Jay : Gloria!
Luke : I think she went insane.
Manny : She's not insane. She's my mother.
Luke : I'm your mother now!
Jay : Gloria... I want to tell you a story... about a guy eating in a
diner, alone. Behind him he hears a woman talking. He doesn't
turn around - 5 minutes, 10 minutes. Just listening to the woman,

Cameron : Yes.
Mitchell : Oh. Claire.
Claire : No, no. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not done. So not done.
Look, here's the thing. We - we have reworks at Christmas now
because that's what they do in Colombia, and I don't mind.
Thanksgiving - that used to be me roasting a turkey, Until the gays
took it over with whatever new turkey-cooking craze it is that you
saw on the food network, All I ask - all I ask is that you leave me
Halloween. Yeah, Halloween. I realize it is a crazy-ass holiday for
a grown woman to care about this much, But it is my crazy-ass
holiday. Mine.

Modern Family Season 2x06 page.7

Cameron : That's a lot of complaining from somebody Who asked
for thirds of our tandoori turkey last year.

Phil : We're back in the game! Let's go!

Phil : Claire.
Claire : No! No! Not ready to talk!

Phil : whoa! That was for you. That was for you. I just did it for
you. No, it wasn't.

Phil : No. Listen... I know I haven't been much help today. That that whole Jerry and Judy thing, It really hit me hard.

Luke : Or I'll have to give you the 'hindenburg' maneuver.",

Claire : Is that why you've been acting like such a nut all day?
Phil : You know, what if someday that's us?
Claire : Honey! Okay, you... you might not want to hear this right
now after the meltdown I just had in there, but... you're kind of
stuck with me.
Phil : You promise?

Claire : I love it! I love it!

Cameron : Oh, one time she caught me staring off. And she goes,
"Cam, what's wrong? You look like a deer in 'head lice'!"
Jay : In the service, I had a job, briefly, handling explosives. which
sounds dangerous, but it's not. You store them at the right
temperature, you have no problems...

Claire : Aw. I do.
Phil : Oh. That's great.
Kids : Trick or treat?
Claire : We should just put out a bowl of candy and have a
cocktail, right?
Phil : Yeah.

Phil : If you tell her she doesn't have a choice, she'll say, "don't you
give me an 'old tomato.'"
Mitchell : Or when she says...
Gloria : okay! Enough! You try speaking in another language!
Everybody out of my house!

Manny : Come in if you dare.
Luke : Thank you for joining us on our special night.

Jay : ...Until you do.

Haley : Other children haven't fared so well.
Phil : Hey!
Alex :Help me! Help me!

2x07 : Chirp

Phil : Really? Okay, you wait in here and listen for it. I'm gonna
wait in there.
Dylan : I mean, it's the least I can do... After...Well, you know.

Claire : What are you doing?
Phil : Shh. One of the smoke alarms is chirping. I'm trying to
figure out which one it is so I can change the battery.
Claire : Well, if anybody can find it it's you.
Phil : You s-sound horrible. Why don't... Why don't you go back to
bed?
Claire : 'cause I've got too much to do. I've got to make the
ladyfingers for the bake sale, and I've got to go by the gym... I left
my phone there yesterday.
Phil : I'll do all that. We're a team. When one of us is weak, we lean
on the other.
Claire : Honey, you don't have to do that stuff.
Phil : Honey, with all you do for me, including going to the gym
four times a week to keep me interested, I got this.
Claire : Don't you have houses to show today?
Phil : They...Canceled.
Claire : Ohh, pumpkin.
Phil : Are you kidding me? It's...lucky. This way I get to stay here
and take care of you.
Claire : Okay.
Phil : Hey!
Dylan : Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Dunphy. Hey. Is Haley ready for
school?
Phil : She's on her way down. Don't get too close to my wife.
Dylan : Haley told you about that? It's just a dream.
Claire : Oh, god.

Claire : I'm coming with you. Boy, I wish Haley would date some
other boys.
Phil : What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?
Claire : Don't. I just feel like she owes it to herself to see what else
is out there. The way that Dylan's always hanging around here,
he's probably gonna try to marry her the second she turns 18.
Phil : Hey, you never know. Maybe those two were meant to be
together... Like we were.
Claire : Honey, Haley and Dylan are not us.
Cameron : No, I think that amount will be fine. I'm just happy you
want Lily. I-I think you're gonna be very happy with her. Okay.
Oh!
Mitchell : Cam? Did you just sell our baby?
Cameron : No, but do you remember that agent we met that
represents child actors, the one who said Lily might have what it
takes and gave us his card?
Mitchell : Yeah, that I threw away.
Cameron : That I fished out of the trash? That was him they're
shooting a children's-furniture-store commercial today, And they
want Lily!
Mitchell : Look, I threw away that card for a reason.
Cameron : Come on, it'll be fun, And Lily will be on TV, and we
can put the money in her college account.
Mitchell : No let's just let our daughter have a normal childhood,
huh?

Phil : Okay, that came from the kitchen.

Cameron : I think that gay cruise has sailed. It's just one
commercial.

Dylan : I-I thought it was in here.

Mitchell : I don't like it. No. No.
Modern Family Season 2x07 page.1

Cameron : Oh, what, so that's it? You're the parent with the final
say? Why is that? Because you make the money?

Jay : Listen, I'm glad you guys stopped by for lunch, 'cause you
know what? I got to work a little late tonight.

Mitchell : It's not about that, and you know it.

Gloria : No, not tonight. Did you forget our date?

Cameron : I wouldn't expect you to understand us. You're not
theater folk.

Jay : No! No. I was kidding!

Mitchell : Neither are you. You did "godspell" one summer in a
barn. You're barn folk.
Cameron : Get used to that jealousy, Lily. Ordinary people just
don't understand us.

Jay : I had no idea what she was talking about. Gloria -god love
her... Likes to celebrate every possible milestone in our
relationship... Day we met... Our first date... which I forgot, so we
got in a big fight. Now we commemorate the big fight.

we did the first time. So romantic.

Gloria : Hola, Jack.

Jack : Hey! What are you guys doing here?

Gloria : Ay. Jack is so nice. I think he really likes Manny.

Gloria : Manny had a doctor's appointment, So we're gonna catch
lunch with Jay... is he there?

Jay : What he likes is getting out of work. Wait a minute, is that
Manny driving?

Jack : More like lifting the fork.

Gloria : Ay, my poor papi. Two doctors in one day.

Manny : Man, I was gonna say that joke!

Manny : Mom, I'm fine. The hospital said I could go back to
school.

Jay : I'm sorry, but I gotta have lunch with my wife today. I know,
baby, but I had to marry her so she could stay in the country.

Gloria : No, you suffered a traumatic experience.

Gloria : Oh, no! Where am I gonna find another husband that
wears sweatpants to work?

Manny : I barely remember it! I remember crashing through the
wall and the ambulance ride to the hospital.
Jay : That wasn't an ambulance. I drove you.

Jay : Resort wear.

Manny : Then what was that siren?

Gloria : Mm-hmm. Maybe last resort.

Jay : That was your mother.
Gloria : I was not that loud.
Modern Family Season 2x07 page.2

Jay : Cars pulled over, honey.

Claire : Is that the smoke detector? I thought you fixed that.

Manny : Jay, I'm sorry about your wall.

Phil : Boy, you're really starting to sound like your old self.

Jay : Wasn't your fault.. And I've already taken care of him.

Claire : You know what this reminds me of?

Gloria : You killed him?

Haley : Huh?

Jay : You can't kill people here. I fired him.

Claire : When you were little and we used to snuggle and watch
soap operas together. Remember that? Nothing's changed. Sonya's
still married to that guy.

Manny : But it was just an accident! He didn't mean it!
Jay : The guy's a screw-up. Should have been gone months ago.
Manny : Can't we just give him another chance?
Jay : What is this "we"? Let me explain something to you people.
Here in this family, it's we. At work, it's me. My rules, my
decisions... Period.
Gloria : That's not fair!
Jay : You mad at me, too?
Gloria : No. You're right. It's your work. Besides, I can't be mad at
you... not on our special day.
Jay : Honey, I was thinking... With what happened to Manny,
maybe we better postpone our special day until next weekend.
Gloria : No. Next weekend is the anniversary Of the first time that
I cooked for you.
Phil : How you doin', typhoid Clairey?
Claire : Hey. what are you doing home?

Haley : One second.
Claire : The one with the... bad hairline.
Haley : Dylan?
Claire : O...Kay.
Haley : God, I miss you, too. oh, it's just a cold, silly. You don't
have to conceive of a world without me. Oh, nothing. I'm just in
bed with my mom. Stop freaking out. It is not coming true.
Phil : Uh, Mrs. Vaughn? It's Phil Dunphy. It's about 3:30. Now, I
know you said you'd moved on, but, um, there's been a significant
price reduction in the, uh, house in Sullivan Canyon, which I
know you loved. So, uh, if there's any chance you might
reconsider, I know you will not be sorry. I can meet you anytime,
so just give me a call. Any... anytime. I can meet you wherever
that... place is that you feel, uh, that would be best. Okay, thank
you. Bye.

Phil : She caught your cold and had to come home. I thought we
should contain you two and keep it from spreading through the
house.

Luke : Dad?

Claire : Come here. I'm so sorry.

Luke : Keeping the germs off me.

Haley : Aw. it's okay.
Claire : Hey, did you finish my ladyfingers?
Phil : Not yet.
Claire : Did you pick up my phone from the gym?

Phil : Hey, buddy! How are ya? W-what are you doin'?
Phil : You care about germs? I've seen you kiss a pigeon on the
mouth.
Luke : My class is going to Disneyland in two days. I can't get
mom's cold.

Phil : Not yet.
Modern Family Season 2x07 page.3

Phil : Oh. Good plan. I remember this. My dad bought it during
the Cuban missile crisis. I never got a turn in that. You think
maybe later I could...

Manny : Fine. Then, under the circumstances, we have nothing
further to talk about. These will be my last words to you.

Luke : Yeah, maybe. What are you doing home in the afternoon?
Phil : Oh, no big deal. Just had a couple of showings fall through.

Manny : Who's there? Okay, you got me. I hope you feel clever
tricking your kid.

Luke : Again?

Gloria : Hello, Mitch!

Phil : You know what I always say.

Mitchell : Hi, Gloria.

Luke : Sure do. Can't get back on that horse unless you fall off.

Gloria : Congratulations!

Phil : That's right.

Mitchell : Hmm? On what?

Luke : Ow. That's loud.

Gloria : Lily's commercial.

Phil : Sorry. Where is that coming from?

Mitchell : Oh, no, no. We turned that down.

Phil : Changing the battery in a smoke detector is what they teach
you in man 101, So, of course, every time I hear that noise, all I
hear is, "beep beep... you're not a man. Beep beep... you're not..."
Really?!

Jay : Knock knock.

Gloria : Are you sure? Because Cam sent me a picture of her in her
makeup chair.
Mitchell : Uh, sorry. He what?
Gloria : Oh, it's so exciting. You have to remember this day so that
you can celebrate it every year.

Luke : Hey, dad. Can you open this for me?
Phil : Oh. Sure, buddy. Ow! Mm!
Luke : What happened?
Phil : I broke a nail.

Commercial Director : Okay, folks, we're about 10 minutes from
shooting! Is talent ready?
Cameron : Yes, uh, she sure is. Did you hear that, Lily? You're the
talent. Isn't that magical? Ooh. Grapes. Mm! And that is a prop.

Jay : Mitchell! What's up?
Mitchell : What do you... what do you mean? You... you just sent
me an urgent text saying to come right over.
Manny : I used Jay's phone.
Mitchell : Oh, what happened to your face?
Manny : Oh, just a little scrape-up. Mitchell, I'd like to engage
your legal services in representing my friend Jack in a wrongfultermination suit.
Jay : Forget it. He's not coming back. Don't take the case, Mitchell.

Haley : Okay, we're really gonna hang up this time. On the count
of three. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Hello? I can't believe he hung up! I'm
calling him back.
Claire : Hey, give me that.
Haley : Oh, my god, is that Jesse?
Claire : Mm-hmm. And he's still married to Angie. You know
something else you might find interesting? Sonya is drinking,
because she married a buffoon when she was young, and now she

Mitchell : I-I don't think I was gonna take the case.
Modern Family Season 2x07 page.4

realizes she's wasted her entire life. Can you imagine making a
mistake like that?

Luke : So, what happens if people stop buying houses? Are we all
gonna have to get jobs?

Haley : Yeah, that must be...Horrible.

Phil : Just a little slump, buddy. Nothing I can't handle.

Claire : Yeah, now she's just a bitter ghost of a woman, filled with
resentment. But that's what happens when you commit to
someone before you see what else is out there.

Ron : Hi, I'm Ron. I work out with Claire at the gym.

Phil : Seriously?!
Haley : She couldn't have laid it on thicker. "ghost of a woman"?
"total buffoon"? I'm not an idiot. She was talking about her and my
dad!
Haley : Yeah, well, maybe Sonya and her husband just need to...
work a little harder.
Claire : Can he give her those years back? I mean, she could have
been something. She could have traveled the world. Been with
fascinating men. She could have accomplished things. That's all
she thinks about now... Every time she looks at him.

Phil : Oh! Yeah. Come on in.
Ron : I brought her phone back. She forgot it yesterday.
Phil : Great. Thanks. I'm Phil, Claire's husband.
Ron : Oh. Uh Claire never mentioned she had a husband. Nice to
meet you.
Phil : You too. Oh, sorry! I burnt my ladyfingers.
Gloria : So quiet. It's like Christian "silence" reading room.
Manny : I'm fine.
Jay : So am I.
Gloria : Okay, my two stubborn burros. I'm going out. Manny, be a
good boy. Jay... Mm, I'll see you later. I think you know where.

Luke : Is that mom's apron?

Jay : Honey? You know what I was just thinking? You know how
when people are in love,s they finish each other's sentences? Like,
um... Tonight we're going to...

Phil : It's an apron. It's unisex. Some of the world's greatest chefs
are men.

Gloria : Have fun!
Jay : Yes. When we get to...

Luke : But it's bumped out where the boobs go. That's happening
more and more.

Gloria : ...Gether later!

Phil : Hadn't noticed. Mrs. Vaughn! Thanks for calling back. Yeah,
I was just about to... I see. Uh, is there anything I can say that
will... All right. Well, thank you very much. And if... o-okay.
Goodbye.

Jay : Tell me.

Phil : Aah! Ow!

Luke : Did you lose another one?
Phil : Hey. Can't lose something you never had, right, pal?
Luke : That was the doorbell, dad.
Phil : Yeah, I know.

Manny : You have no idea where you're going, do you?
Manny : Hire Jack back.
Jay : Forget it.
Manny : Your funeral.
Cameron : Okay, Lily, daddy's gonna be right over here. Okay. Oh,
and, um, by the way, if it helps, I have a list of things Lily can do.
She can blow a kiss, uh, flap her arms like a bird...
Modern Family Season 2x07 page.5

Commercial Director : Thank you. I'll...Keep at in mind.

Mitchell : This commercial... it's a big stereotype.

Cameron : Okay. Thank you.

Cameron : It's called "ironic."

Mitchell : Cam. Cam.

Mitchell : No, this is why Lily was perfect... she's Asian. She's a
prop.

Cameron : How did you get on the set?
Mitchell : I walked on it. It's not MGM. It's a warehouse behind a
mattress store. I can't believe you went behind my back. We
agreed...

Cameron : It's called "niche casting."

Cameron : We didn't agree on anything. You agreed. We don't
have to agree on everything. I didn't like the book you bought her
last week, but I didn't stop you from reading it to her.

Commercial Director : Let's go again!

Mitchell : Well, what was wrong with it?
Cameron : How was it a big day for Biscuit, Mitchell? How?
Mitchell : Okay, this isn't about Biscuit.
Cameron : I know. It's about our daughter, Lily.
Mitchell : No, you want to know the truth? I think it's about you,
Cam. I think you're using our daughter to fulfill some childhood
dream of yours.
Commercial Director : Okay. Parents... We're ready to start rolling.
Now, while we're doing the shoot, Jim and Deb here will be doing
the kids' voice-overs into the mike... Kind of like "look who's
talking."
Cameron : Oh. That's great. There are a lot of important people
here, so I'm not gonna get mad, but I resent the implication that I
would do anything that's not in the best interest of our daughter.

Mitchell : Stop telling me what stuff is called! You're so blinded by
the spotlight, you can't see what's really going on here!
Woman : All right. Here we go. Let's roll, please!
Commercial Director : Action!
Man : Oh, no! We are trapped in a city of high furniture prices!
Woman : Ohh! Can no one protect us from these high prices?!
Man : look! Over there!
Woman : Oh-ohh-oh!
Man : It's save-zilla!
Woman : He's knocking down prices on everything from bibs to
cribs!
Man : Half off on playpens!
Woman : Ahh!
Man : High chairs are low chairs!
Cameron : Excuse me. 'scuse me. 'scuse me! 'scuse me! 'scuse me!
Commercial Director : Cut! What's the problem?

Commercial Director : Okay, let's try a take! And...Action!

Cameron : Well, don't you think this commercial just might be the
teeniest bit racist? I mean, um, save-zilla?

Man : oh, no! We are lost in a city of high furniture prices!

Commercial Director : It's not racist. It's satire.

Woman : Ohh! Can no one protect us from these high prices?!
Commercial Director : Cut! Lighting problem. One sec.

Cameron : No, I know, but maybe... Maybe we could just tone it
down a bit. Maybe not hit the accents so hard?

Cameron : You can apologize to me anytime you're ready.

Commercial Director : This is the commercial you agreed to.

Mitchell : Are you kidding me?

Cameron : Yeah, well, I know. I just... I can't let my daughter do
this.

Cameron : What?

Modern Family Season 2x07 page.6

Commercial Director : We had an agreement.

Manny : The pier.

Cameron : Well, I also have the best attorney in town, So do your
worst. And by the way, Lily is Vietnamese, not Japanese. There's a
big difference, but you wouldn't know that, because you're only
interested in seeing these children as interchangeable stereotypes,
not human beings. Come on, Lily. Let's go.

Jay : Thanks.

Mitchell : Cam? Cam, that's not...
Cameron : Hi, buddy. There we go.
Jay : Going to meet your mother. Figured it out all by myself. Two
years ago, we got our marriage license, we went to a little hot dog
stand she said was the most romantic meal she ever had in her life.
That's it, isn't it? Yeah, that's it. You can give me the cold shoulder
the rest of your life. Jack's not coming back. See, I could overlook
the goofing off, but you could have been seriously hurt today.
Anybody puts my kid in danger doesn't get a second chance ever.
I'll see you later.
Manny : Did you just call me your kid?
Jay : Oh, geez.
Manny : You've never said that before.
Jay : Sure I have.
Manny : Unh-unh.
Jay : Well, of course you're my kid. I mean, what do you think?
Manny : You're going to the wrong place.

Haley : But maybe Sonya didn't make a mistake, maybe she just
met her soul mate when she was young.
Claire : No, no, no. That never happens. See, she threw her life
away, and now she wants out.
Haley : Okay, let's cut the crap. We're not talking about some
character on a soap opera here, are we?
Claire : No. No, we're not. Honey, I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt
your feelings, but... ...I've been feeling that way for a really long
time, And...Can we be honest with each other? He's kind of a
doofus.
Haley : I guess, but... I thought you liked that about him.
Claire : Mm, mnh-mnh. No, I never did. Believe me, honey. There
are many better options out there.
Haley : Like who?
Claire : I don't know. Off the top of my head, uh... How about that
cute guy who delivers the pizzas?
Haley : He's like 18!
Claire : So?
Phil : Don't mind me, ladies. This is the last one. I've changed the
batteries in every last smoke detector in the house.

Jay : What?

Luke : Hey, dad. I think I found a place online where I can sell this
organ. Can you drive me to the black market?

Manny : It's not your wedding license.

Phil : I think they mean a different kind of organ, buddy.

Jay : What is it?

Claire : Sweetie, why are you trying to sell that?

Manny : First kiss.

Luke : In case things with dad's job get even worse.

Jay : No. Just tell me.
Manny : I mean, your first kiss... with my mom.

Phil : Honestly, I don't know why everybody's making such a big
deal. Everything's fine. It makes no sense! I changed every one!

Jay : My god, you're right. Thanks!

Claire : I'm gonna call my dad.
Modern Family Season 2x07 page.7

Phil : No, we're not calling anyone! I can handle this. I just need
the old burglar basher.

being a team? Right? We're supposed to lean on each other.
Honey... I have faith in you. Mm.

Luke : Is that your college cheerleading baton?

Phil : I must be catching your cold.

Phil : Not when you're on the business end of it.

Claire : Mm-hmm. Okay. You know what? Let's just get new
smoke detectors.

Claire : Oh!
Phil : Guess that one won't be chirping anymore, will it?
Claire : Honey...
Haley : Go after him.
Claire : Oh, no, he just needs to blow off some steam.
Phil : How's that for battery?!
Haley : Mom, like it or not, you made a commitment, and maybe
that doesn't mean anything to you anymore, but you owe it to this
family to save your marriage and give it one more try.
Claire : What?
Phil : End of the line, smokey Joe!
Haley : Look, dad may be a doofus, But he is 10 times better than
any pizza-delivery boy. Go to him.

Phil : We already changed them out last year. Remember, buddy?
You helped me.
Luke : Sure did.
Phil : Wait a minute. What'd you do with the old ones?
Luke : You told me to throw them in the garbage, So I put them in
the attic to make a robot.
Phil : It's the old ones. The batteries are dying, And we can hear
them through the vents. you did it, buddy! I'm sorry.
Claire : I love you.
Phil : I love you.
Haley : I did that.

Claire : Did you...

Claire : Oh. That must be the pizza I ordered.

Phil : I just detected your ass gettin' kicked!

Haley : Pizza? You ordered pizza?

Claire : Okay. Honey...

Claire : Yeah. I was just sort of in the mood, you know?

Phil : Thought I forgot about you, didn't you? Nope.

Haley : But we had pizza a couple nights ago.

Claire : Phil, no. Stop.

Claire : I know, but I had an urge, And when you get an urge, you
get an urge.

Phil : I gotta stop the damn chirping.
Claire : This isn't about the noise. Sweetie... ...You're having a bad
day.
Phil : At the end of a bad month.
Claire : I know.
Phil : You know how scary that is, Claire?
Claire : No. No, I don't, because you never tell me the bad stuff.
You only share all the good stuff. Honey, what happened to us

Haley : Okay, here, I'll get it!
Claire : No, sweetie, I've got it.
Haley : No, mom. You're always asking me to do things. I'll get it.
Here, just sit back, relax.
Claire : I-I...Really...
Haley : Okay, get the change. I'll get the pizza. Don't worry. Here!
And I think it's best you don't come around here anymore!

Modern Family
2x08 : Manny Get Your Gun

Gloria : Ay! Sorry, sorry. I couldn't find my earring. So, what were
we talking about, huh?

Manny : Good afternoon. Thanks for coming. It's so nice to spend
my birthday surrounded by so many smiling faces. I was almost
too depressed to come today. I realized I let my childhood slip
away.

Claire : Honey, come on. We're gonna be late. Let's go.

Claire : Come on, everybody! We're gonna be late for Manny's
birthday! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

Claire : Hmm. That's right. Come on, honey.

Luke : I'm ready, mom.
Claire : You sure, honey?

Phil : Yeah, yeah, just filling out the application to family camp.
Claire : Ohh.
Phil : You don't win the "dirty dancing" competition and not go
back to defend your crown.
Phil : But shoot for the king... You better kill him.

Luke : Yep.

Phil : Every summer, we spend a week at family camp. It's just
like regular camp, but with the family!

Claire : Then take a quick peek at your feet.

Claire : Yeah. I don't think that needed any clarification, Phil.

Luke : Oh! Come on, Luke!

Phil : Somebody's still a little toy about losing last year's color war.
Claire : Not.

Mitchell : Are you gonna walk faster, or should I get Lily's stroller
out of the car and push you?
Cameron : Would you relax? The restaurant's like five minutes
away from here... ohh, free lotion.
Mitchell : Stop stopping to smell the roses. Manny's present.
Cameron : Ohh, you are such a Pritchett.
Mitchell : What's that supposed to mean?
Jay : Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Gloria : I'm looking for the keys!
Jay : Of course you are.
Jay : I like being on time. It's easy 'cause I'm organized. Not my
wife. You'd think growing up in a place full of death squads and
drunken uncles, she'd have learned to move a little bit faster.

Phil : She was on team blue...
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Phil : Or as I like to refer to them as team blue-zer. And I was on
white.
Claire : That's good.
Phil : And if you ain't white...
Claire : No.
Phil : You ain't right!
Claire : Phil! Have you learned nothing?
Phil : My good man.
Claire : Okay, come on, everybody. Front door! Now!
Phil : Claire, relax. It takes 15 minutes to get there.
Modern Family Season 2x08 page.1

Claire : It takes 20 minutes.
Phil : If we take your route.

Jay : Are you kidding me? You were born 16. You know, we
wouldn't be having this problem if you hadn't lost the spare set.

Claire : Well, my way is the most direct.

Gloria : I didn't lose them. Somebody came in here and stole them!

Phil : Directly into traffic.

Jay : And left the car.

Claire : Uh, your way is directly into... The suckiest way.

Manny : What do you mean, I was born 16?

Phil : Want to make this interesting?

Jay : I'm just saying, you were never much of a kid. And that's a
good thing, 'cause I never liked kids. You know, you ought to try
the fridge. 'Cause that's where we found your cellphone.

Alex : Yeah, I don't think that's possible.
Phil : We take two cars and see who gets there first.
Claire : Fine. Fine. Let's do that. It's on.
Phil : Yeah! It is on! I'll take the girls.
Claire : Luke, your dad and I are splitting up.
Luke : Why?
Alex : Another one of their stupid arguments.

Gloria : It was only one time, Jay. And you know I always eat after
I talk to my mother.
Jay : Happy Birthday, old man.
Manny : Well, I've forgotten a lot of things in my life. But what Jay
said hit me hard. I'd forgotten to have a childhood.

Luke : Okay. I'll go with dad.
Claire : No, no. Buddy. Come with me.

Alex : Dad, that was a stop sign.

Phil : Prepare to be... my shoes. Come on, Phil!

Phil : I'll stop twice on the way back.

Manny : How do I look?

Haley : Oh, good, it'll give us a chance to pick up that hubcap you
lost cutting through the temple parking lot. Yellow... yellow! Okay.

Jay : Like al Capone.
Jay : Happy Birthday, kid.

Claire : Are you seeing this? We are making every light, and we
don't even have to speed. The system works.

Manny : Whoa! A bb gun?!

Luke : Mom?

Jay : Enjoy. That's the best gift my dad ever gave me.

Claire : I know, I went a little fast back there, but, really, 40 is the
same as 35.

Manny : Thanks!

Gloria : My keys are nowhere! We're gonna have to go in your car.
Jay : It's in the shop. Where was the last place you put your keys?
Gloria : Oh, so now it's my fault? Where was the last place you
put my keys? Mm-hmm.
Jay : In your hand when I bought you the car.
Manny : Hey, Jay, on the box, it says "ages 16 and up." Is this an
appropriate gift for me?

Luke : You say that a lot.
Phil : I don't think you two appreciate what's at stake here our
lives?
Haley : Our lives ?

Modern Family Season 2x08 page.2

Phil : You know I love your mother, but I think you also know a
certain look she gets that says, "just listen to me, I'm always right."

Alex : We should call the cops and say mom's car was stolen. They
arrest her, we win.

Haley : You mean her face?

Phil : No, they trace those calls. But this is great. Thinking like a
team! Good practice for family camp.

Phil : N-now we're getting this. If we're right this one time, then
we never have to be right again. When she says, "that balloon can't
carry a person, Phil," I say, "Manny's birthday."

Haley : We're, uh, we're doing that again?
Phil : Oh, yeah! And this year I predict total white domination.

Alex : "Take your jacket, Alex. I think it's gonna rain."
Phil : "Manny's birthday."

Haley : Can't go back there.

Haley : Don't look at me. Look at the road.

Alex : I heard this summer there's gonna be a hoedown.

Phil : "Manny's birthday."

Haley : I can't.

Haley : No, dad! Look at the road! There's a truck!

Alex : Haley!

Phil : Sweet baby!

Haley : I can't! I can't.

Claire : We are so kicking your dad's butt! We are the best ones!
Luke : How come you and dad are breaking up?

Mitchell : Eight minutes talking to the lady at the stationery store
and still no present.

Claire : What?

Cameron : You know, I think a new friend is like a present.

Luke : If it's just a little disagreement, can't you just work it out?

Mitchell : Yeah, I read that card, too. Can we please just buy the
next thing we see and get out of here?

Claire : Oh, sweetie, you thought that when I said we were
splitting up... No. No, your dad and I are fine, honey. We just were
gonna take separate cars to see who could get to the restaurant
faster.

Cameron : You know, why can't you enjoy this? It's a beautiful
afternoon, Lily's with a sitter. The day is ours!
Donald : Helen! Helen! Helen!

Luke : Oh, that's a relief.

Cameron : Helen!!

Claire : Ohh, you must have been feeling awful back there. I am so
sorry.

Mitchell : Oh, look at that. Another friend. Off we go. Very busy.

Luke : It's okay.

Cameron : No. Stop. You are too tied to your rigid schedules.
You're missing life. It took all of two seconds to help this nice man.

Claire : Why did you say you'd go with your dad?

Donald : W-w-wait. Wait. There's more.
Cameron : Two seconds. Yeah.

Alex : Great. Mom gets to be right again.

Donald : Tell her I'm so sorry, I've always loved her.

Phil : Hey, bad attitudes lose races.

Cameron : He says he's so sorry! And that he's always loved you!

Haley : No, swerving into a curb and popping your tire loses
races.

Donald : Please come up and talk to me.
Modern Family Season 2x08 page.3

Cameron : Please come up and talk to him! His life would be
empty without you! I'm sorry I'm going off script. It just felt right.

Manny : Boy. I'm a boy!

Donald : Oh. Good. Oh. T-too late.

Mitchell : You all right? You okay?

Cameron : No, you know what? Give him your cellphone. I'll
chase Helen down and give her my phone. They can hash it out.

Donald : W-why do you ask?

Mitchell : Are you... are you serious?
Cameron : Yes, I'm serious as a heart attack.
Jay : You always do this. Now we're gonna be late to our own
party.
Gloria : Stop shouting.
Jay : Well, technically, I wasn't really...
Manny : Uh, yes, hello. Is Seymour butts there? I'd never made a
prank call... Never mixed different sodas together to see what
they'd taste like. So I knew I had to make the most of what little
childhood I had left. Not "lutts." I'm looking for butts. Yes, I'm
trying to get ahold of butts. Very funny. I don't have time for this
foolishness.

Mitchell : Oh. Okay. Well, I think this is for you.
Helen : I-I don't know what to say to him.
Cameron : Just open your heart and listen, Helen.
Helen : Okay. Hello?
Donald : I dropped your phone.
Mitchell : Yeah. I was here when it happened. Okay. It's all right.
We'll just...
Helen : I can't. I-I just can't.
Cameron : Helen, you have to try. I once almost let my own fears
stop me from embarking on a relationship, and I would have lost
the love of my life.
Helen : Ohh.
Donald : Helen!

Jay : Maybe if you had a system for where you leave things.

Helen : Donald!

Gloria : I have a system. I put down things, then I remember
where I put them.

Mitchell : Cam...

Jay : And that would be preferable to, say, putting them on the key
holder which just happens to look like a large key.

Cameron : Hang on. Hang on, Helen! I'll have you down in a jiffy!
Hold on tight! Ow. Nails. Helen. Nails. Nails. Nails. Helen.
Donald : Helen, please just give me a chance.

Gloria : Stop screaming!

Cameron : Give him a chance!!

Jay : What are you doing?

Mitchell : She's right here. Cam, come on. We're running out of
time.

Manny : Turning back the clock. Disgusting!

Cameron : We're running out of time? Sensitive. Go to him.

Jay : Don't judge me. You've never been married. This never
happened.

Helen : Ohh, I-it's nice that you care so much about us.

Manny : I don't know what you're talking about.

Helen : But what about his wife?

Jay : That's a good man.

Cameron : It was a pleasure meeting you both.

Cameron : Without love we're nothing.

Haley : Dad, are you crying?
Claire : I get it, Luke. You think he's the fun one. That's why you'd
go with him.

Phil : Nope.

Luke : What?

Phil : Yep.

Claire : You think your dad is more fun than I am.

Alex : Oh, my God. He is crying. I've never seen dad cry before.

Luke : Definitely.

Haley : But, dad, if you cry, then I'll cry!

Claire : "Definitely."

Phil : I'm not crying.

Luke : Dad's, like, crazy-fun.

Haley : We made our daddy cry!

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Phil : You called me daddy?

Luke : But you're nice.

Haley : Because you are our daddy!

Claire : I'm nice?!

Phil : I'll always be your daddy!

Alex : Are you sure you're okay?

Luke : Well, not now.
Luke : Don't cry, mom.
Alex : Tell him.
Phil : Tell me what?
Alex : Nothing.
Phil : Hey, what do we call daddy's car, girls?
Girls : The cone of trust.
Phil : The cone of trust. Exactamundo. Where you can speak your
mind with no judgment. So, what is it? Boys? Your bodies are
changing? Eggs?
Alex : No! No. We were just thinking that maybe... If... if you're
open to it...
Haley : Dad, we love you, but we do not want to go to family
camp this year.

Claire : I am not crying. Let me fill you in on a little secret, Luke.
When I met your dad, I was fun, too. But I had to give all that up,
because you can't have two fun parents. That's a carnival. You
know that kid Liam who wears pajama pants to school and pays
for things with a $100 bill? Two fun parents. Mark my words. Mmhmm.
Phil : Oh, my God! Ohh!
Luke : You're fun, too, mom. Uh-huh. I just said I'd go with dad
because I think he'd need me more.

Alex : Dad? Are you upset?

Gloria : How come I do all the looking and you do all the sitting?

Phil : Nope.

Jay : 'Cause you do all the losing.

Haley : Then what was that sniff?

Gloria : Oh, and you're this close of doing all the sleeping in a tent
in the backyard!

Phil : Sniff? What sniff? I'm... I'm, uh... I'm actually relieved. The
day that I've been dreading, uh, the day when you two finally
outgrow me, has finally arrived, and I'm handling it really well.

Jay : Did you check your purse?
Gloria : Yes, of course!
Modern Family Season 2x08 page.5

Jay : It's a big purse. You might want to look again.
Gloria : Okay. I check. You rest. No. There's nothing.
Jay : You're sure?
Gloria : Yes. I've looked twice now. There's nothing. Okay.
Jay : Then you better call us a cab! Manny! Manny? What the hell?
Where'd that thing come from?
Manny : Christmas. Two years ago. Never took it out of the box.
"Who would enjoy that?" I thought. A kid, that's who.
Jay : Well, come on. We've got your party.
Manny : What's the point? You were right. I-I was born 16. I've
lost my childhood.

Gloria : I am so sick of stubborn men! You, you act like a little boy
that doesn't want to accept that he's wrong. And you like a sad old
man that doesn't wt to be happy! That's it!
Manny : You could have shot me!
Gloria : Come on, Manny. I could've unbuttoned your shirt if I
wanted to. Now come here, or sink! And I'm taking this with me
in the car.
Jay : Vámonos.
Cameron : I know that face, Mitchell.
Mitchell : Okay, a-and we're walking.

Gloria : Why did you want me to look again in my purse, Jay,
huh? Is it because you put the keys in there?

Cameron : It means you were right and I was wrong for trying to
help two people.

Jay : No. Why did you find it?

Mitchell : Adulterers?

Gloria : Yes, I found them because you put the keys in there!
Manny, what the hell are you doing there?

Cameron : Fair enough.

Jay : He wants to cancel his party because he missed his
childhood.

Cameron : But my impulse was still right.

Gloria : The party that I have rescheduled three times, changed
the restaurant twice so that the whole family could be together?!

Cameron : Life is about being... yes. You know what? Here we do
go. It's about being spontaneous. It's about throwing yourself into
something, not working long hours every night at the office. It's
like you're living your l... what is this?

Manny : Please send my regrets. Now, if I could have a little
privacy...
Gloria : Privacy?! Esto es lo que me faltaba a mí. Privacy?! ¿en esta
casa?

Mitchell : A-actually, the most adult adulterers ever.
Mitchell : Oh, God. Here we go.

Mitchell : I don't know.

Manny : The second thing that slipped right out from under me
today.

Cameron : Excuse me, constable, what... what is going on? Oh, it's
a flash mob! It's a flash mob! Ooh! We saw it on YouTube.
Remember? People get together and choreograph big dance
numbers!

Jay : Okay, time to get out.

Mitchell : We should go. T-this is kind of weird.

Manny : The first was my childhood.

Cameron : No, this is joyful, Mitchell. You, of all people, should...

Jay : Is that a skateboard down there?

Jay : I get it!

Modern Family Season 2x08 page.6

Mitchell : Cam's right. I can be a little rigid. So when Chad from
accounting, who I always thought was gay but apparently is not,
um, told me about this flash mob, I thought, "Hells yes." Uh, we've
been practicing after work a couple of nights a week. And it's... it's
been a big commitment, but it's totally worth it. This dance is my
love letter to Cam.
Mitchell : Okay, so, this is why I was rushing you around. Huh?
What do you think of me now?
Cameron : How could you, Mitchell?
Mitchell : What? Cameron. Cameron.
Cameron : Not now. Donald!
Luke : You do fun stuff. You put that potato chip in my sandwich.
That was a crunchy surprise.
Claire : Nope, that was your dad. Everything fun is your dad.
Second Christmas, Italian-accent night... this race.
Luke : Which we could've won. Your way is way faster.
Claire : It is, isn't it? Buckle up, Luke. Today you have two fun
parents.
Luke : Come on, mom. You can do it.

Jay : I'm trying to teach you to be organized. Your mind is
scattered, Gloria.
Gloria : Your mind is gonna be scattered. Manny, hand me the
gun!
Cameron : I appreciate the gesture, and I'm not proud of how I'm
feeling right now, but the fact is, you cheated on me.
Mitchell : In what way did I cheat on you?
Cameron : You cheated on me with choreography, and that is the
worst kind.
Mitchell : Well, it really isn't.
Cameron : You danced without me, Mitchell!
Phil : If I'd known it was my last summer there, I'd have gone for
the lead in "pippin."
Alex : Dad, look up ahead. Coming at us. There's mom! Beat her!
Haley : I don't think he's in the mood for that right now.
Alex : Hold on. No. If ever a man needed a win, it's this man.
Haley : What do you say, dad?
Phil : Okay. This one's for family camp.

Claire : That's right I can.

Alex : Whoo!

Gloria : Tell me the truth, Jay. Did you put the key in my bag?

Girls : Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Ohhh...

Jay : No.
Gloria : I won't be mad.
Jay : In order to prove a point, I may have...
Gloria : I knew it! Ow!
Jay : Why did I get you such a big watch?!
Gloria : Why, Jay?! What point did you have to prove?!

Haley : Whoo-hoo!
Claire : This is so inappropriate!
Luke : I love you!
Girls : Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Manny : Mom, look out!
Gloria : Ay!
Mitchell : Cam! Anybody hurt?
Cmaeron : I am.
Modern Family Season 2x08 page.7

Manny : I was almost too depressed to come today. I realized I let
my childhood slip away. Look at Luke there... making one big
straw out of three. Never change, Luke. I really thought it was too
late for me. But watching all you acting like children, it hit me...
I've got plenty of time left to be a kid. Anyway, happy birthday to
me.
All : Happy birthday, Manny.
Cameron : : I have been a child.
Jay : I'm sorry I hid the keys.
Gloria : I'm sorry I shoot the island. Mmm.
Phil : We're totally racing home.
Claire : I'm way ahead of you. As usual.
Manny : They say it's going to be a rainy weekend.
Jay : They don't know.
Manny : I do. My knee's been singing all morning.
Jay : Unbelievable. Mother of g...
Gloria : Put them down and walk away.
Jay : You know, Gloria...

Haley : What? We only do this when I get one right.

2x09 : Mother Tucker
Haley : So the rate of defusion equals... something.. times the
square root of... Something... I give up.
Alex : Aw, so close.
Haley : Shut up.
David : Hey, don't worry. You'll get it. You know, a lot of famous
scientists are women.
Haley : They're fat, though, right?
Claire : Come on, Alex. It's time for your Cello lesson. How's the
tutoring going?

Cameron : Momma should be here by now. I wonder what's
keeping her.
Mitchell : Well, Cam, that depends. Did she take her jalopy or one
of them new fancy flyin' machines?
Cameron : You know, Missouri is more Cosmopolitan than you
give it credit for, Mitchell. It's got a very vibrant cowboy-poetry
scene.
Mitchell : I'm not sure you're making the point that you think...
Cameron : That's her. Come on. Look alive. Look alive. Momma!
Barb : Oh, my baby! Oh, my little bomber. Puppy kiss.

Alex : Are you familiar with the term "Throwing good money after
bad"?

Cameron : Mwah! Mwah!

Haley : Are you familiar with the term "Dunphy, party of one"?
Because you will be.

Mitchell : Aah, hey, Barb!

Claire : Girls.

Cameron : Ohh! Oh-ho! Oh, yeah!

Barb : Mitchell, get over here!
Barb : Oh, my baby's baby! How are you?

David : Haley's coming along really well, Mrs. Dunphy.
Claire : Good. Good. Well, the key is to take a lot of little breaks so
you don't get frustrated and want to quit.

Cameron : Well, I don't want to overstate this, but my mom is the
greatest woman that ever lived.

Haley : Got it.

Mitchell : Cam loves his mom.

Claire : I was talking to David. Come on, Sweetie.

Cameron : She raised 4 kids, 2 barns, and a whole lot of hell.
Mitchell : Well, that sounds like a country song.

Alex : I'm just saying... She's never gonna get a job, and how do
we know the right middle-eastern businessman wouldn't treat her
great?
Claire : I left my shopping list inside. For the record, we thought
she could live with you.
Alex : Like I'm gonna tell any of you where I live.
Claire : Oh. Haley!

Cameron : And that song would be called "The greatest woman
that ever lived."
Mitchell : Cam loves his mom.
[OPENING CREDITS]
Mitchell : From the minute I met Barb, she has been open and
loving and... and caring.
Modern Family Season 2x09 page.1

Manny : Jay, what are your symptoms? Nausea, bloating?
Barb : Oh, I have missed these shoulders!
Mitchell : Ooh...Aah...
Mitchell : If I had one complaint... and I do... it's the inappropriate
putting of her hands on my body.

Gloria : Manny, what did I say about getting off that crazy doctor
website?
Manny : I'm just worried about Jay. Stomach pains can mean a lot
of things... intestinal blockage... Do you have a fever?
Gloria : Stop it! Manny, he's fine. Tell him you're fine.
Jay : I'm fine.

Mitchell : Hey, Barb. I got you the cranberries you wanted for the
stuffing.

Gloria : Okay, good. Get in the car.

Barb : Oh, bless your heart. Mmm-mm-hmm! Mm-mm-mmm!

Gloria : Jay, you know what happens when I shop angry.

Jay : Uh, home fine, not mall fine.
Jay : I'll clear a space.

Barb : Let me get in there and help ya. Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! And a
horsey bite.

Gloria : Mm.

Mitchell : Oh!

Jay : Go play.

Manny : I'm not loving your color.
Manny : Don't be a hero.

Barb : This is how I like to cuddle.
Mitchell : It's been... It's been going on a long time.

Alex : So, dumb guys go for dumb girls, and smart guys go for
dumb girls? What do the smart girls get?
Phil : Cats mostly.

Gloria : Jay, you want to go to the mall with me?
Jay : No, actually, my stomach's a little funny today.

Claire : So, Haley, how long have I been paying this guy to make
out with you?

Gloria : Oh, I am so sorry, Papi. Maybe we'll stop first at the crib
store, and you lay down, and I buy you a little dress, huh?

Haley : Uh, about a week. First it was just to shut him up, but now
I'm starting to like him.

Jay : Gloria thinks Americans are babies.
Gloria : Well, in Colombia, we couldn't go running to the hospital
for every little sniffle or dislocated shoulder.
Gloria : Okay. Good. 5-6. I serve. Huh?

Claire : If you really like him, though, you have to break up with
Dylan.
Phil : What? No!
Claire : Believe me... and it's best for everybody if you just do it
quickly.
Phil : I can't believe we're having this conversation. He's like part
of the family.
Claire : Trust me... It's the right thing to do. Just end it.
Modern Family Season 2x09 page.2

Phil : Okay, but be gentle. Boys are surprisingly sensitive at that
age.
Claire : Water-polo-girl story.

Mitchell : I have not!
Claire : Okay. Sorry. My mistake. Must be Cam's mom... her
issues.

Phil : Yes, I'm gonna tell the water-polo-girl story, 'cause it hurt!
Okay, so I'm working in the principal's office. She walks in, hair all
silver from the chlorine... Tells me she wants her varsity jacket
back. I tear up a little, then I tear up a lot. I'm begging, I'm
begging... at some point I realize I'm sitting on the button to the
high-school intercom system. Yuk it up, ladies. Wasn't funny then,
is not funny now. It was traumatic, Haley. Don't do Dylan like
Linda "The Cannon" did me.

Mitchell : What are you doing?

Claire : Oh, honey... That was a long time ago.

Claire : Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell...

Phil : I loved her.

Mitchell : Force field!

Claire : Okay. I know.

Claire: That never stops being fun.

Phil : You know what? Maybe I'll call Dylan after he talks to
Haley. He's gonna need someone to lean on.

Mitchell : Good. Listen, this is... This is not in my head, Claire.
And it's actually getting worse.

Claire : But that someone should not be his ex-girlfriend's father.
Honey, when Dylan is out of her life, he should be out of ours.

Claire : What does Cam say?

Phil : You've always hated Dylan.
Claire : I have not always hated Dylan. I have always thought that
Haley could do better. Plus, the new boyfriend is super smart.
Haley : It's done. We broke up.

Claire : Nothing... Just getting a spoon.
Mitchell : Stop it.
Claire : Is it bothering you?
Mitchell : Yes, it is.
Claire : Hey, Mitchell
Mitchell : Claire, stop it! Stop it!

Mitchell : Well, he never seems to notice. And I certainly can't talk
to him about it because God forbid I say anything negative about
his mom. One time I added salt to her casserole... And he went
into the garage and punched the car.

Phil : What?!

Claire : Okay, Mitchell, if this is happening... and I'm pretty sure it
isn't...

Haley : I texted Dylan. It's over.

Mitchell : Thank you. Supportive.

Phil : I'll bet that's him. Yep. Sad-face emoticon! You can feel the
hurt through the phone!

Claire : Then you need Cam to see his mom feeling you up and
then make Cam deal with it.
Mitchell : Ew.

Mitchell : Cam's mom spend half of dinner with her hands all
over me. Oh. It was like she was blind and wanted to know what
my thighs looked like.

Claire : Think about it. Hi, Dylan.

Claire : Are you sure? I mean, are you really the best judge of this
kind of a thing? You've had boundary issues since you were a kid.

Claire : Actually, I think we're gonna stick with "Mrs. Dunphy."
Come on in. How are you doing?

Dylan : Hey, Mrs. Dunphy. Mm. Or, I guess, now that Haley and I
broke up, I should call you "Claire."

Modern Family Season 2x09 page.3

Dylan : Not so good. I mean, everywhere I look, I see her face.
Uhh.
Claire : To be fair, Dylan, that is a family portrait.
Dylan : I got to go get some of my stuff. Is that cool?
Claire : Oh, sure. Yeah.
Dylan : There she is again!
Claire : Oh, don't look on the bookshelf! You're just gonna...
Jay : Hey, kid, you got a minute? I need the name of that medical
website.
Manny : Can this wait until I'm home? I'm having the round of my
life.

Phil : Okay. I'm gonna miss that bad boy. When I forget my own
axe, sometimes I come in here and noodle on it. Actually, I've been
writing a little song of my own. Might be able to pluck out a few...
Dylan : You know, I keep on hoping that this is just a dream, that
Haley and I didn't really break up. But it's not a dream... Unless
the whole thing was a dream and we never even dated in the first
place.
Phil : Weird... this is kind of what my song's about.
Dylan : Yeah. Weird.
Phil : Hey... I know this is tough, but you're gonna be fine. You
know, I was a lot like you in High School... except my hair was
shorter and my guitar was a flute.

Jay : I've been thinking, I might have a couple of those,

Dylan : Well, if you want your own guitar, I mean, we could... we
could go out and we'd pick you one.

Manny : Uh, I see. You might as well play through. It's gonna be a
while.

Phil : Oh, I don't... I don't know if that's such a good idea.

Jay : I mean, I'm probably wrong, but, you know, I just, uh, want
to make sure.
Gloria : Is that Manny?
Jay : Work. So, uh, tell them I'll... I'll get that order out this
afternoon, huh?
Manny : Did she buy that? Because it sounded fake on this end.
Jay : I'll talk to you later, Tom. Tom.
Gloria : Mm.
Phil : Dylan! Oh, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.

Dylan : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Well I guess I'll get going. So... I
can...Well, be alone forever.
Phil : Uh, what... what the hell? Yeah! Let's go guitar shopping.
Dylan : Awesome. Uh, do me a favor. Don't... Don't tell Mrs.
Dunphy?
Dylan : Yeah. Definitely. You got it.
Phil : Okay. All right.
Dylan : Well, I guess I'll see ya.
Phil : Okay. You... you, uh, you can go ahead and exit through
the...Front door.
Dylan : Oh, right. Habit.

Dylan : Hey, Mr. Dunphy.
Phil : Hey, now that you guys are broken up, you can call me
whatever you want. Phil, Vitamin p., P. Daddy.

Cameron : My old yearbook!

Dylan : Okay, Phil.

Cameron : Oh! Ho ho! Oh, look.

Barb : You know I saved them all.
Barb : What?
Modern Family Season 2x09 page.4

Cameron : "You're the cutest boy in school. We're gonna have an
awesome summer. Smooches... Brenda." Oh, Brenda, you are
about to have the most confusing summer of your life.

Cameron : See you in the room for a minute? Thank you. It's very
hot. Don't burn your tongue.

Mitchell : Hey, guys!
Barb : Hey. Oh, there's Mitchell! My little corn silk!

Cameron : Okay, I am not gonna cry, but I want to know why,
Mitchell, why you are presenting to my mother like a baboon.

Mitchell : Ah. Oh! Oh, Barb, oh, you are such a good hugger.

Mitchell : I wanted you to see her fondling me.

Cameron : Isn't she the best hugger?

Cameron : So, you do want me to cry.

Barb : Oh, thank you.

Mitchell : No, no, Cam, it's just that... She's always touching me
inappropriately, and you never seem to notice.

Mitchell : Oh, and look what I... I got you, Barb.
Barb : What's that? Oh...
Mitchell : Scratchers!
Barb : Mmm... thank you. Nice.
Cameron : Oh, that's your tea. I'm gonna get your tea.
Barb : Thanks, honey. Well, I need a quarter.
Mitchell : Oh. Let me have that. Oh, wow, yeah, feel free to fish
around in there. Cam? Cam. I'd like a cup, too, please.
Cameron : Just a second.
Mitchell : Ohh, Barb, ohh. You know what? I-I-I strained myself so
bad today.
Barb : Ohh. Well, what's hurtin' on ya?
Mitchell : It's this area between my, uh, lower back and upper
thigh.

Barb : All right, honey.

Cameron : Show me, Mitchell. Show me on Lily's doll where my
mother is touching you.
Mitchell : I know that you don't want to hear this, but she's
handsy, and it makes me uncomfortable.
Cameron : Oh, my God. I know what this is. You're just not used
to having a mother that shows affection.
Mitchell : Oh, do not make this about my mother.
Cameron : I didn't. But it is normal for a mother to be physical.
And it is not strange for an occasional hug or a little pat on tanny.
Mitchell : Okay, these aren't pats, Cam... no. She squeezes and
lingers!
Cameron : Show me where she squeezes and lingers.

Barb : Sounds like your Fanny.

Mitchell : Cam, put the doll down. I don't know if this is just
sexual or... or crazy town, but your mother cannot keep her hands
off of me, and it's creeping me out No. Oh... Barb...

Mitchell : It's my Fanny. It's really knotted up.

Cameron : Let me show you where you stabbed my momma.

Barb : Well, you need someone to work on that.
Mitchell : Ohh, I would love that. Just... It's really seized up. Just
put your fingers all over my... My Fanny. Your magic fingers...
Barb.

Phil : Thanks for helping me pick out my axe. You were so right,
by the way. The one with two necks would have been overkill.

Cameron : Momma? Your tea. Mitchell?

Phil : Diet starts tomorrow! Don't tell Mrs. Dunphy about this,
either.

Barb : Thanks, Sweetie.

Dylan : If you want, you can have some of that.

Modern Family Season 2x09 page.5

Dylan : I, uh, I always wanted to go to this place with Haley, but
she said it looked stupid.
Phil : She's a girl with strong opinions... like her mother. Claire
hates this new sweatshirt I bought. She says it looks like
something a girl would wear to the beach.
Dylan : Yeah, it does.
Phil : But I wear it anyway. See? I figure, why be alive if you can't
do the things you're passionate about? What are you passionate
about, Dylan?
Dylan : Uh, I always wanted to drive to Graceland.
Phil : Fun! What else?
Dylan : I know a guy who can get me a pet bobcat.
Phil : Yeah! No, you don't really know what they're gonna do. The
point is, you got your whole life ahead of you. Enjoy being single.
I really got to play that song for you. This is all in there.
Dylan : Yeah.
Phil : Awesome. Be right back.
Haley : Hey, hey, come here. Is that guy over there with someone?
Boy : Uh-huh.
Haley : Could you tell if there was anything going on between
them?
Boy : I don't know. They were talking about taking a trip to
Graceland together.

Manny : Well, describe the pain.
Jay : It's like I'm being stabbed, but also like I ate a bad scallop
that's stabbing me from the inside.
Manny : That's colorful, but there's no box for that.
Gloria : What are you guys looking at?
Jay : Girls!
Manny : Huffington post... Girls.
Gloria : Manny, let me see that screen. What did I tell you?
Jay : It's not his fault. I asked him to look. I'm starting to think I
have a serious problem here.
Gloria : Yes, you do! That computer! You read it there, you think it
here, you feel it here. You want to feel better? There... you're cured.
Jay : Give me 15 minutes, then tell Florence Nightingale I went to
the hospital.
Haley : I'm gonna kill her! I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill both
of them!
Claire : What happened?
Haley : Dylan has a new girlfriend!
Phil : When did that happen?
Claire : Who cares?
Phil : I'm just surprised he didn't say anything... to you.
Haley : He's not answering my texts. How could he do this to me?!

Haley : He just wants to go 'cause he thinks it's an amusement
park!

Claire : Oh, honey, you were the one who broke up with him.

Manny : I got to tell you, this is looking more and more like
diverticulitis.

Claire : No, he's not. What? No, he's not better! No, you know
who's better? David... David the tutor. Smart, smart David? Maybe
that's him right now! Do you want the house to yourself? For just
a little while.

Jay : Do they say how to treat it? Like a heating pad or... Ohh!...
There it is again.

Haley : I didn't think he was gonna find someone so fast! Maybe
he's better than I thought.

Dylan : I got your texts. You swore a lot.
Modern Family Season 2x09 page.6

Haley : Who is she?

Haley : Me too, baby.

Dylan : Who is who?

Dylan : But then your Dad helped me figure out maybe it's best if
we're apart.

Haley : Your new girlfriend. I need her name and address, so I can
mess her up.

Claire : Nice.

Dylan : I don't have a new girlfriend.

Dylan : I mean, I think I just need a little time to date... Dylan.

Haley : Don't play dumb, Dylan.

Claire: Mm-hmm.

Dylan : I'm not. I'm never playing dumb!

Dylan : And I mean me, not another guy named Dylan.

Haley : I saw you at that stupid restaurant, sharing a sundae with
her ugly sweatshirt on the chair. Oh, is that the skank?

Haley : So, we're still broken up?

Dylan : No... No, there's... There's no skank.

Haley : Wow. Okay... Um... I don't know... I'll see you.

Haley : Well, then why aren't yo answering it!

Dylan : Yeah.

Dylan : 'Cause I want to talk to you.

Claire : Bye.

Haley : Well, I want to talk to her. I'm gonna call her back and tell
her to keep her hands off of what belongs to me.
Dylan : Haley...
Phil : Hello.
Haley : Dad?

Dylan : Yeah, I think so.

Gloria : Are you okay, baby? Do you need another pillow?
Jay : I know you think this is nothing, but he did say it could be an
ulcer.

Phil : Haley?

Gloria : He also said it could be gas. Do you want me to burp you?
Come here. Come here.

Haley : Oh...My...God... the sweatshirt? That was you with Dylan?!

Manny : Dollars to doughnuts, it's diverticulitis.

Claire : Wait, you're the other girl?

Doctor : Actually, it's not.

Phil : No, we're just friends!

Gloria : Aha!

Claire : Phil, what are you...
Phil : Shh!

Doctor : You have acute pendicitis. We need to get you into
surgery right away. Emergency surgery.

Claire :Okay, put the phone down. What is going on?

Jay : I told you it was something. Aha!

Phil : He needed someone to talk to. He took the break-up pretty
hard.

Gloria : That can't be right. You have to check again!

Claire : But...
Haley : You did?
Dylan : Ohh... yeah. I mean, I kept on hoping that we'd get back
together. Thinking of you with someone else just drove me crazy.

Doctor : The tests are conclusive. Everything will be all right, Mr.
Pritchett. Let's go.
Gloria : No, Jay, if that's true, then I'm the worst wife in the whole
wide world! I made you suffer for two whole days!
Jay : Honey, it's okay.
Modern Family Season 2x09 page.7

Gloria : No, it's not okay! Why?! Why do I always almost kill my
husbands?!
Jay : And I want to hear this story sometime, but I'm sort of
counting down to a rupture here!

Barb : From now on, if I go too far, please, you just tell me about it.
Okay. What is that? Oh... Ohh! Almost lost my bracelet. That
would be an area that's okay.
Mitchell : No!

Gloria : No!! You can't go without forgiving me! What if you die in
there? What do I do without you?!

Barb : Oh, dang it! I'll get it. I'll get it. Oh, no, I saw where it fell.

Jay : I forgive you, but nobody dies of an appendectomy!

Cameron : What's going on?

Manny : True, it's usually the anesthesia that gets you. You're over
60, right?

Barb : I lost my bracelet in here.

Mitchell : Force field! Force field!

Gloria : I will never forget you, Jay!!

Cameron : Momma! Listen, I think this might be one of those
situations where Mitchell feels like you're crossing a boundary.

Jay : Could you go back to not caring, please?!

Barb : Really?
Cameron : Yeah.

Barb : Mitchell, it's Barb.

Barb : Like, this too?

Mitchell : Ohh, Barb. I'm so sorry.

Cameron : Yeah.

Barb : Well, no, no, honey, you hush. Look, I... I've been thinking
about what I heard, and... Maybe I do touch you too much. And I
could say it's 'cause we're a family, but, you know, I don't know. I
guess I have been having some fun with you, and I...I thought that
it was harmless, but I would never want to make you
uncomfortable.

Barb : Well... I...I got to have a good long think about how I
conduct myself. I'm truly sorry, Mitchell.

Mitchell : Barb, it's my fault, too.
Barb : So we're okay?

Mitchell : It's okay! It's okay.
Barb : Well, let's take one quick picture, and we'll get out of his
way.
Cameron : Yeah. Absolutely. Scooch together there.
Barb : This all right?

Mitchell : Yes, yes, of course.

Cameron : Okay.

Barb : Thank God. 'Cause I couldn't live with myself if things
stayed weird between us.

Phil : Hey.

Mitchell : Uh, Cam?

Haley : I miss him.

Cameron : What is it?

Phil : Yeah. He was your first real boyfriend.

Barb : Well, we got it all worked out, Sweetie!

Haley : I keep expecting him to show up. He used to come by at
night, and I'd sneak out to see him.

Cameron : Oh, great. Let me get my camera!
Mitchell : Okay, that's not necessary... No!

Phil : Yeah, I know.
Haley : You knew?
Modern Family Season 2x09 page.8

Phil : His car is 30 years old and doesn't have a muffler. And he
honked.
Haley : I loved that car.
Phil : I rode in it to the guitar store. I felt like I was flying. I know
it hurts now, sweetheart, but... that's how you know it was a
relationship worth having.
Haley : Thanks, Dad.
Phil : So Dylan are you loving Graceland?... Yeah, that's true.
Probably would be cooler if they had roller coasters. Still, it's fun
to see where the king lived, huh?... No. No, no, no. That's just an
expression. America doesn't have a king. ... Yeah. Oh, sure.... Uhhuh... When?... Well, that's not always the case. Huh?... So, Dylan,
did you get a chance to listen to that song I sent you?... No? You
got seven minutes?

2x10 : Dance Dance Revelation
Claire : Okay. I'll... I'll get that. Hello?
Jay : Hey, Manny's getting his outfit together for the dance tonight.
Claire : I was just taking some supplies out to the car. Isn't this
exciting... The boys' first dance?

Claire : Oh, hey, Mitch! Where are you?
Mitchell : Oh, we're at the park. You would not believe how some
of these people dress their kids. Lily's friend just pulled a Britney
Spears getting out of a sandbox car.
Claire : So, dad's on the line.
Jay : Do you have a teal pocket square for Manny?
Mitchell : Cam, Manny needs a teal pocket square.

Jay : Greatest day of my life. Does Phil have a green pocket square
for him?

Cameron : Oh, I've got teal, I've got aqua, I've got sea foam...

Manny : Teal!

Manny : Yes!

Jay : Teal.

Cameron : Oh, you know what? I lent it to Andre.

Claire : I don't know. I don't think Phil's really a pocket-square
kind of a guy.

Mitchell : Ah. He lent it to Andre.

Phil : Wow! Wow.

Manny : What's that mean? What's that mean?!

Claire : Why don't we conference in Mitch?

Jay : Now I got to go to the mall.

Gloria : Ay! Look. This might work.

Luke : Is this okay?

Manny : Well, except that it's turquoise... Oh, and a bra?!

Claire : Oh, hey! Luke has to go to the mall, too.

Gloria : Do you think the kids in my village had pocket squares?

Luke : What?

Manny : Here we go with the village.

Claire : Phil.

Claire : Dad, are you still there?

Phil : Let's go, Incredible Hulk.

Mitchell : Yeah, Cam's got one. Cam's got one.

Jay : Flag on the play.

Jay : Unfortunately, yes.
Gloria : Please ask Claire what time do I need to be at the school
to help set up.
Jay : Gloria wants to know...
Claire : No, I heard. I heard. Um, tell her thank you so much, but
we have all the help we could possibly need, and she doesn't even
have to come tonight. She doesn't want to.
Jay : Claire said...
Gloria : I heard.
Mitchell : Hello?

Woman : Hey. Hi.
Mitchell : Hi.
Cameron : Hi.
Woman : Uh, is that your little girl over there... Lily?
Mitchell : Yes. Look at her.
Cameron : Yes.
Woman : Uh, well, this is a little bit awkward, but she bit Tyler.
Mitchell : Oh, no.
Modern Family Season 2x10 page.1

Cameron : Oh, my goodness. I... I don't even know what to say.
Mitchell : She's never done anything like that before. How did it
happen?
Woman : I don't know. I didn't see.
Mitchell : Uh-huh.
Cameron : Mm-hmm.
Mitchell : It's time to play everyone's favorite game.
Cameron : "Let's blame the gay dads"!
Mitchell : You know who had straight parents? Adolf Hitler.
Cameron : Charles Manson.

Jay : Yep. Pretty soon, you get some hair on your chest, you start
answering the phone, people don't think you're ladies. Come on,
today, Miss Daisy.
Manny : Actually, Miss Daisy was the one being driven, not the
one driving.
Jay : Never saw it.
Manny : It's called "Driving Miss Daisy."
Jay : You got a real lip on you today. You know that? Hey! That
was our spot! What are you doing? You're gonna let him snake
your spot?
Phil : Not worth it.

Mitchell : Shall we go on?

Jay : Boys, here's the only thing you got to know about being a
man... never let someone take what is yours.

Cameron : Naomi Campbell.

Phil : Unless it's just a parking spot and there's plenty of others.

Woman : I-I know it happened. He's got bite marks on his arm.

Jay : That's sweet, Phil. You ought to write that down. You got any
lipstick in your purse?

Mitchell : Oh. Wow, yeah. Oh, gosh, someone really sunk their
teeth into you, huh? It's 'cause you're such a yummy little guy!
Yes! Our daughter didn't do that.
Woman : But he said...

Phil : I love Jay. Are you kidding me? He's my boy. Yeah, he gives
me a hard time, but that's the deal with a father-in-law. The key is,
I never let him see just how much it devastates me.

Mitchell : Right. He's probably just confused. You know who I bet
did it, though? Billy. Rhymes with Lily. Plus, he is very aggressive.

Phil : It's "Dunphy."

Cameron : His babysitter's right over there. She's... she's not much
of a disciplinarian. Ohh. Because I can assure you, if our child did
something like this, we would be on her like white on rice. And I
know that sounds a little bit like a racial slur because we're white
and she presumably likes rice, but I didn't intend it that way.

Jay : That's what I said... "Dumphy."
Phil : No, not "dumb." "Dunphy."
Jay : "Dumphy."
Phil : Say "done."
Jay : Done.

Jay : Ah. Finally. There's a spot.

Phil : Say "fee."

Phil : Oh. Guys, I am just bursting with pride right now. Your first
dance. Soon you're gonna be men. I want you to know that there's
more to being a man than just shopping for fancy outfits.

Jay : Fee.
Phil : "Done-fee."
Jay : "Dumphy."
Modern Family Season 2x10 page.2

Claire : All right, just bring it this way? This way... There it is.
Perfect. Thank you. Perfect.
Bethenny : Cla-a-aire?
Claire : What?

Claire : She suggested an "Arabian Nights" theme. Isn't it a little
soon?
Claire : Okay. Um, hey, everybody? Do you know Gloria, Manny's
mom? She's here to help us out today.

Bethenny : Can you ask Gus to fix that light? I asked him, but he
just growled at me.

Gloria : I'm the co-chair.

Claire : Oh, gosh. Okay. Gus, stop scaring Bethenny and fix the
light, please? Don't make me come over there.

Claire : So, the kids are gonna be here in two hours, so everybody
back to work.

Gus : I'm busy. You fix it.

Gloria : Everybody back to work.

Claire : Is this because I said I wouldn't come to the dance with
you? Gus, I'm a married woman. People would talk.

Claire : I just said that.

Women : Oh. Mm-hmm.

Gloria : And I just co-said it.

Gus : One dance with me, you'd forget all about him.
Claire : Yeah, I already have a husband who doesn't fix lights.
Please?
Bethenny : Thank you so much. This school would literally fall
apart without you. Well, I don't know about "literally," but...
Gloria : Hola, hola! I'm here!
Claire : Oh, you came anyway. That's great.
Gloria : I think it's great, too.
Gloria : A few weeks ago, they asked for someone to be in charge
of the school dance, and I volunteered.
Claire : The school asks for volunteers so that everybody will feel
included, but who are they kidding? They want me to do it. I've
put on every school dance since Haley was 12. It's my thing.
Gloria : They made us co-chairs, which means we're supposed to
do everything together, but Claire won't take any of my ideas.

Cameron : I mean, the nerve of that lady accusing Lily?
Mitchell : Ugh! Mm. Well, you know what? You can't change
people, Cam. I mean, we just have to rise above.
Cameron : Ow! Ow!
Mitchell : What happened?
Cameron : She bit me.
Mitchell : Are you serious?
Cameron : Ohh! Ah! She did it again! It's like "Twilight" back here!
Woman : No! No ice cream for you, Billy, because the lady say you
biting!
Cameron : Okay. Okay. Go. Go. Yeah. Go, go, go. Okay. Drive.
Manny : Are you sure this is teal? 'Cause I'm starting to get a real
strong green thing here.
Jay : That's the fluorescent lights.
Manny : Do you mind if I walk this over to lamps galore?
Jay : I need you to worry about this less.
Modern Family Season 2x10 page.3

Phil : Guess who fit into the suit on the mannequin and saved us
20%?

Mitchell : Okay, I don't get it. Why is she biting? Lily, why are you
biting?

Luke : Here's something I didn't know about mannequins... They
don't have a wiener.

Cameron : She's not biting. She's teething.

Manny : What the heck is that?

Mitchell : On people! All right, if she starts biting her play dates,
she's gonna be a pariah.

Phil : It's a nicer word for "penis."

Cameron : Try "piranha."

Manny : No, I mean, what the heck is this?

Mitchell : Really, Cam?

Luke : It's a tie.

Cameron : It was right there.

Manny : It's teal.
Luke I don't care. I just grabbed the first one I saw.

Mitchell : All right, you should also know that I in no way... in no
way... blame you.

Manny : Well, grab a different one.

Cameron : Well, thank you. Why would you blame me?

Luke : No! Now I like it.

Mitchell : I don't.

Jay : Uh, I think we were here first.

Cameron : Well, good, because I don't blame you.

Man : I just have one thing. I'm in a big rush.

Mitchell : Well, obviously.

Jay : So are we.

Cameron : Uh, okay, well, now I'm starting to feel the blame.

Phil : That's fine. Go ahead.

Mitchell : No. No. Don't... It's... It's just that you're with her all
day.

Jay : Seriously?
Phil : Jay, it's not a big deal.
Man : And can you give me the sale prices for some things I
bought last week?
Jay : Oh, for God's sake! Now, this is what I'm talking about, boys.
You give people an inch, they'll run all over you.
Phil : Or you could just be nice...
Jay : Pay it forward.
Phil : They don't make movies out of bad ideas.

Cameron : Oh, wow. I have a daughter who bites and a partner
who stings.
Mitchell : Okay. Okay, you want to know the truth? Sometimes
you've sent her some mixed signals.
Cameron : I'm gonna bite your feet! I'm gonna bite 'em right off!
Cameron : Oh, I'm not the one who uses my teeth like a multi-tool.

Jay : All I know is you got to fight for what you want. If there's one
job available, this guy just got it, and they go hungry at the
"Dumphys'."

Mitchell : Here we go. Cookies for Lily...And wine for us. Okay.

Phil : "Dunphys'."

Mitchell : I can't believe you would equate...
Cameron : Oh, don't bite my head off. I'm not a pack of batteries.

Gloria : Un poquito mã¡s acã¡. Es perfecto allã­. Ay, good.
Bellissimo.

Gloria : Smells funny, Claire!
Claire : So sorry. Keep goin'!

Claire : Whoa!
Gloria : Eeh!

Claire : What? We needed chairs.

Claire : Why is this box here?!
Gloria : I am sorry... we did, because we were moving the tables.

[In Spanish]

Claire : Well, why are you moving the tables?

Gloria : There are ants all over.

Gloria : So the kids have more space to dance. It's better this way.

Gus : I'm going to clean them all up tomorrow.

Claire : Is it really, Gloria? Because right now it kind of just looks
like a clump of tables and a big open space. Look, I'm sorry, but
we've always done it this way, and I think it's gonna throw people
off if you move them around.

Gloria : No, you need to clean them before the children get here.

Bethenny : Oh, my God, these tables look great! Who did this?
Gloria : I did!
Bethenny : I love it!
Gloria : Hello. We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Gloria.
Bethenny : I'm Bethenny. I don't know if anybody's ever told you
this, but you're really pretty.
Claire : No. No, Bethenny. No one's ever told her that.
Bethenny : I am seriously freaking out about these tables!
Claire : You know what? Let's just put a pin in where we're gonna
put the tables.
Gloria : Yes, we're keeping the tables! So what else can I do?
Claire : Um...You can... Help me with the chairs.
Gloria : Okay.
Claire : We need a lot of them. They're under the stage
right...Here. There you go.
Gloria : It's like dirty and dark there, no?
Claire : Yeah, I know. Bummer, right?
Gloria : Ay!
Claire : Off you go.

Gus : Of course.
Claire : What are you guys talking about?
Gloria : No, nothing. He was just saying how much he loves the
tables.
Man : If I had the receipt, I wouldn't need you to look it up.
Manny : At this rate, I'm going to miss the first dance... at my
wedding!
Luke : I thought he only had one item.
Jay : Tell your dad, if it were up to me, we'd have been in and out
of here in about 10 minutes.
Phil : You mentioned that.
Jay : And I'll probably mention it again, because, thanks to
someone, we're gonna be here for a while.
Phil : Yeah, I get it.
Jay : You know, Luke, you should order that suit in a larger size,
because by the time we get out of here...
Phil : I...get...it.
Jay : Pay for the suit. Where the hell are you going?
Phil : Luke needs...Socks.
Modern Family Season 2x10 page.5

Luke : Make 'em teal!

Phil : You see what I mean?

Manny : You're playing a very dangerous game.

Man : I-I get it. I get it.

Jay : Hey, boys... Look who it is... the guy that stole our parking
spot.

Phil : No, I'm not sure you do! You sprayed before "men"! You
went, "Oasis for Men."

Luke : Are you going to hit him? I'd totally hit him.

Man : Okay. Okay.

Jay : I'm not gonna hit him, but I'm gonna give him a piece of my
mind. Now, boys, pay attention... You want to be men, this is how
you handle a jerk like this. Hey, chief? You know, you stole our
parking space today.

Phil : Men! Men! Men!

Man : What?
Jay : That's right. I was waiting for the parking space, you sneaked
right in there... That make you feel like a big man?
Man : Did I? I didn't even notice.
Jay : That's no excuse.
Man : I'm really sorry. My dog died today. I had to put him to
sleep. 14 years. He was all I had. Now I can't stand the thought of
going back to my empty apartment, so I just keep wandering
around the mall.

Man : Stop it! Stop it!
Phil : Men! Men! Men! Men!
Man : Stop it!
Phil : Men! Men! Men! Men!
Man : Stop it!
Phil : Men! Men! Men! Men! Men!
Jay : Hey, Phil.
Phil : Hey. I don't know what happened. I just... I... I don't know
what happened.

Jay : You know what? Forget about the... spot.

Jay : Look, I might've come down on you a little bit hard today.
I'm sorry.

Man : Oh, God! That was his name!

Phil : I remember pretending to go look for some socks...

Luke : Do not hit him.

Jay : I mean, it's, uh, my fault. I pushed your buttons. My fatherin-law was the same way with me. He was horrible.

Man : Oasis for Men?

Phil : Grandpa Lucas? He was a sweetheart.

Phil : That's funny. You made that sound like a question, then you
didn't wait for me to answer.

Jay : Yeah, after the stroke mellowed him out good. Before? An
animal.

Man : What?

Phil : We named Luke after him.

Phil : Here, let me show you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go... You go,
"Oasis for Men?" You see what I mean? You went, "Oasis for Men?
You should have said, "Oasis for Men?" Then I'd go, "yeah, give
me two." But instead, you went, "Oasis for Men."

Jay : Everything I did was wrong. If I said it was white, he'd say it
was black. Although he never said anything was black 'cause he
was a pretty big racist.
Phil : I wear his watch.

Man : Okay. I get it.

Jay : I hated him. Hated him. And I was thinking... I don't know... I
don't want you to think the same way about me.
Modern Family Season 2x10 page.6

Phil : You ever think about maybe not being a jerk to me so much?

Mitchell : Yeah, you know she didn't fight in Vietnam, right?

Jay : Now, see, you got to stop taking that stuff personally. I'm like
that with everybody! I'm tough!

Cameron : I don't know anything anymore. What else does it say?

Phil : And...mean.
Jay : I don't like to take guff!
Phil : Or people's feelings into consideration.
Jay : Okay, okay. I can't swear my way's the right way. I see you
smiling, skipping around, and I think sometimes... I don't know...
maybe the boys would be better off if they were a little bit more
like you.
Phil : You know, skipping burns more calories than running.
That's...
Jay : We're done here. Oh, hey, listen. He didn't tell me, but what'd
you do to that guy, huh? Did you get him?
Phil : Yeah, I sprayed him with cologne.
Jay : I'm sorry I asked.
Phil : No, but, like, a lot of cologne. I just, like, got way up in there.
Jay : Good boy.
Cameron : Did you find anything yet?
Mitchell : Yes, there's a whole section on biting on this mommy
forum.
Cameron : Oh, good. What does it say?
Mitchell : Uh, "my son was biting, "so I got a stranger to yell at
him. "Being disciplined by someone else outside the family scared
him into stopping."
Cameron : Idiots!
Mitchell : Cam!
Cameron : What? I am not hiring some hobo to come over here
and traumatize my child. She's already prone to flashbacks, if you
know what I mean.

Mitchell : Okay, well, this one says, "when my daughter bit her
brother, "I put a pinch of pepper in her mouth." "She cried and
cried, but she never bit again." Smiley face.
Cameron : Oh, well, the smiley face makes it okay. "I
waterboarded our toddler... LOL!"
Mitchell : Well, all right, what do you suggest we do?
Cameron : That we log off the Spanish inquisition website and
handle this with love. Okay, Lily... *Take a bite of an apple, take a
bite of a pear, take a bite of the cookie that you left over there.
Here's one thing you should never do don't bite Taylor or Brandon
or Sue because people aren't food people aren't food your friends
will run away if they're scared of being chewed and as a side note,
private parts are private.*
Mitchell : Well... problem solved.
Cameron : I know you're being sarcastic, but you don't know that
it's not. Ow! Honey.
Mitchell : Did she just bite you again?
Cameron : No.
Mitchell : That is it. I am getting the pepper!
Cameron : N... no, you are not.
Mitchell : Cam, you're not doing her any favors by being soft.
Cameron : Oh, well, then, why don't you just skip the pepper, I'll
get some pliers, and we'll pull her teeth now!
Mitchell : Relax! It's a seasoning.
Cameron : Okay. Well, then, why don't you try some?
Mitchell : Stop.
Cameron : No. Try a little.
Mitchell : Stop it. Stop it, Cam. Stop it.

Modern Family Season 2x10 page.7

Cameron : No, try a little bit. Don't you hit me. Here. Put some in
there.

Claire : No. I am fine. I do not need to talk.

Mitchell : No!

Gloria : Well, you've been pushing me away the whole week.
You've been fighting all my ideas.

Cameron : Ow! You bit me! Mm!

Claire : That's because this is my thing, Gloria.

Mitchell : Well... Why don't you sing me a song about it?

Gloria : Why can't it be my thing, too, Claire?

Claire : Oh, look at you two in your matching ties!
Manny : Don't get me started.
Claire : Ohh, come here. Luke, sweetie, are you wearing cologne?
Luke : No. Dad attacked the perfume guy and then hugged me.

Claire : Because everything is your thing! This... this is the one
thing that was my thing. This is my only thing. Oh my God, this is
my only thing. And then you come along and you steal my
thunder with your tight dresses and your great ideas. I was the
one that all the moms looked up to. I was the only one that Gus
liked.
Gloria : Ay! Please. You like him so much, you can keep him.

Claire : I saw the boys in those adorable little suits, and it made
me realize this dance is about them. It's not about me and my
petty little competition with... with Gloria.
Gloria : Just look at the walls in here. Who wears that to a kids'
dance?
Bethenny : I know. She looks amazing.
Man : Okay, I'm gonna slow things down with a blast from the
past for our chaperones.
Claire : Oh, my God. No, I'm fine. I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I
need a paper towel.
Gus : I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
Claire : No... Of course you didn't. Of course you didn't. 'Cause it's
Gloria's night. That's right. It's all about Gloria, Gloria, Gloria!
When you're done getting married... maybe you can mop this up a
little.
Gloria : What was that?

Claire : It's not the same now that I know he likes you. That
sounds really insane, but this isn't actually about Gus.
Gloria : Really? Because you've been talking a lot about him.
Claire : Gloria, Gus is a symbol.
Gloria : A sex symbol?
Claire : Stop it, Gloria. I'm already crying.
Gloria : Claire... I didn't come here to steal your thunder. Your
thunder is your thunder, and my thunder is my thunder.
Claire : I know. It's just that God gave you so much thunder.
Gloria : Yeah, maybe too much. I hate how those women look at
me. You think I don't know what they're thinking? "Ah, here
comes the hot one with the big boobies that is gonna steal my
husband." And maybe they don't let their kids play with Manny. I
volunteer because I want them to see that there's so much more to
me.
Claire : Why didn't you tell me that?

Gus : It's this damn uniform.

Gloria : Maybe for the same reason you didn't tell me you had a
wed thing for Gus... It's embarrassing.

Gloria : Okay, we need to talk.

Claire : Okay. I am sorry. I made this whole thing into some
ridiculous competition, and...I'm pathetic.
Modern Family Season 2x10 page.8

Gloria : You're not pathetic. Okay, that's a little bit sad.
Phil : We like to think we're so smart and we have all the answers.
And we want to pass all that on to our children. But... If you
scratch beneath the surface, you don't have to dig very deep to
find the kid you were. Which is why it's kind of crazy that now
we're raising kids of our own.
Mitchell : You know what? This is a milestone. We're accepting
that our little angel isn't perfect.
Cameron : That's right. And it's okay.
Mitchell : I-I take it back... She is perfect.
Phil : But I guess that's the real circle of life. Your parents faked
their way through it, you fake your way through it, and, hopefully,
you don't raise a serial killer.
Mitchell : Ow! That's not funny.
Cameron : I am so sorry... No, just come over. We'll watch a movie,
put the whole thing behind you. Okay, see you in a bit. That was
Longines. He's in a very bad place.
Mitchell : Oh, no. What happened?
Cameron : Well, apparently some maniac went crazy at the mall
and attacked him with Oasis for Men.
Mitchell : Oh. Well, I think we all knew that day was coming.
Cameron : Mm.
Mitchell : All right. Wish me luck.
Cameron : Good luck.
Mitchell : Okay, honey. Please don't hurt daddy. All right. "Ahh."

Barry : Cameron, give me your arm.
Cameron : Hey. Good night, honey. Mitchell! There's a stranger in
our hot tub!

Cameron : Okay.

Mitchell : Who is it?!

Barry : Oh, I'm studying to be a reiki master. What I'm doing is I'm
transferring my positive energy into Cameron, and I'm taking out
all the negative energy.

Cameron : You do know what "stranger" means, don't you?
Mitchell : Oh, my G... Oh, my God! How long has he been there?

Mitchell : Whatcha doin'?

Cameron : I saw him exactly one second before you. You know
everything I know.

Mitchell : Okay. Mm.

Mitchell : Okay, I'm... I'm calling 911.

Barry : Does it feel warm?

Cameron : I'm getting my bat.

Cameron : It does. It feels warm, Mitchell.

Mitchell : Maybe we're overreacting.

Mitchell : Imagine that. In a hot tub.

Cameron : Now, do you feel that? I do.

Cameron : Yeah, he could have a very good reason for be...
Mitchell : We should at least say hello.

Luke : What are you gonna do when he drives by?

Cameron : It's only polite.

Claire : I'm gonna tell him to slow down.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Luke : I think you should drag him out of his car, and we all get
turns punching him in the stomach until he barfs.

Barry : Okay. so I looked that coyote dead in the eye, and I let him
know, without saying a word, "I will not harm you... but I'm the
Alpha here." And he just stared back at me... Mesmerized.

Claire : Honey, I think I'm just gonna turn over his license plate to
the police.
Luke : Please. Order a pizza and call the cops. We'll see who gets
here first.

Mitchell : Whoa.
Barry : Yeah.
Cameron : Amazing.
Cameron : Turns out, Barry just moved into the apartment
upstairs and thought the hot tub was for the whole building.
Anyway, he's a super-cool guy, and he's straight, so there's no
weirdness.
Mitchell : Aside from you turning into a 16-year-old girl.

Claire : Ever since they put those speed bumps on Oakmont, some
lunatic driver in a crazy sports car has been racing down our
street, and it is dangerous. We've got kids here and babies in
strollers and moms who like to jog.
Phil : She has to run every day, or she goes crazy. She's like a
border collie.
Claire : You're comparing me to a dog?
Phil : The smartest dogs in the world.
Modern Family Season 2x11 page.1

Phil : Yeah. No. Yeah, that's great. Okay, fire away.
Phil : What are you guys doing?

Claire : 2-u-r-n-8-0-1. Yeah.

Luke : What the cops won't.

Phil : Oh, uh, just the address. Yep. Okay. 1-0...

Claire : We are catching that speeder, and when we do, he's gonna
get an earful of this. Slow down, jerk!

Claire : 8-0-1. 2-u-r-n.

Phil : Oh! Okay! Easy.

Claire : 8-0-1.

Haley : Oh, my God. Mom, what are you doing? Why are you
being such a freak?!

Phil : 2...

Claire : I am being a freak for safety. And I'm doing this for you,
because I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

Claire : U-r...

Haley : Well, it's embarrassing. Mom, you need a life. Why can't
you just volunteer at the museum or bring pudding to old people?
Claire : Honey, if anybody's being embarrassing right now, it's
you.
Phil : Luke, I am your father!
Claire : That takes me back to the delivery room.
Phil : That's what I said to you when you were coming out of your
mom's lady parts.
Haley : Oh, my God, dad! Oh, my God. I know those girls.
Claire : What? Are you ashamed of us?
Haley : Yes!
Phil : Ooh. Sweet valley high! This is that woman from the house
on seventh street!
Claire : Oh, good!
Phil : Yeah, if I sell it by the end of next month, I dethrone Gil
thorpe as salesman of the quarter.
Claire : Ahh.
Luke : That's awesome, dad.
Phil : It is awesome. Phil Dunphy.
Claire : That's the speeder! That's the speeder! Yeah. Slow down,
jerk! Slow down!

Phil : 1...North...Seventh...

Luke : I gave it to dad.
Phil : ...Street. Oh, God. Okay. 10-4. This is gonna be my best year
since 2006.
Jay : Let's go, kid. Back to the salt mine.
Manny : That's okay, Jay. I'm biking to school today.
Jay : Good for you.
Manny : There's a bunch of cool kids who ride their bikes every
day. Thought I'd join them.
Jay : Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What the hell is that?
Manny : My new bike. Mom got it for me yesterday. Pretty sweet,
huh?
Jay : Training wheels?
Manny : Nice ones. Custom made. They don't usually come on
bikes this size.
Jay : Gloria!
Manny : What's wrong?
Jay : You don't know how to ride a bike?
Manny : I know how to ride this bike.
Jay : Stephen Hawking could ride that bike.
Gloria : Ay. What happened? Did he fall?

Modern Family Season 2x11 page.2

Jay : How could he fall? You can't send him to school on a bike
with training wheels. They'll make fun of him. Didn't you teach
him how to ride a bike?

Laura : Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to buy me a beer before you
can put your hand up my sweater.

Gloria : How could I? I don't know how to ride a bike.

Laura : Put on the house this weekend, the listing's yours.

Jay : 2/3 of my house can't do what a billion Chinese do.

Phil : Bring it, Laura.

Gloria : My mother thought that riding a bike was dangerous. She
would say, "that's how people grab you!"
Jay : Okay, this is how it's going down. Today I'm driving you to
school, on the weekend, I'm buying you a bike, and I'm teaching
both of you.
Manny : I'm nervous... but I'm excited.
Gloria : You two have fun. I pass. It makes no sense. There's no
reason that thing should stay upright.
Jay : There's no reason you should stay upright, but it just works.
Laura : Hey, Phil. Come on in.
Phil : Laura, good day. Well, I couldn't love this entry any more.
It's very welcoming.
Laura : Yeah, I got a thing in 10 minutes, so I have to make this
quick. Great.
Phil : Um, let me run through my three-pronged approach to
selling...
Laura : I only need one prong... Sell the house. I don't want to be
that yutz who prices her house too high so it sits around for a year
while every lookie-loo without something to do on Sundays is
going through my underwear drawer. What's the number?
Phil : Well, there are quite a few factors to take into...
Laura : Need a number.

Phil : Oh, I had no intention...

Phil : You want to test me? I've been tested my whole life. They
could never find anything.
Phil : So, uh, Sunday 12:00 to 4:00 for the open house? That works
for you?
Laura : Great.
Phil : Great. Oh, and if you have any questions or you need
anything, just call. When you work with me, you're working with
a friend.
Laura : That is so sweet. I like you. God, I hope I don't have to fire
you.
Phil : Hi. This is Claire. Leave a message. Hey, honey. It's me. I just
finished the meeting, and she is the perfect client. Realistic about
the price... She wants to sell fast, and she's a real character. You got
to...Meet her. But she's moving soon, so what's the point?
Mitchell : Hey!
Cameron : Wow, you worked late.
Mitchell : Yes. Brutal day. I just want to sit.
Cameron : Perfect. Lily's asleep. Barry's meeting us in the hot tub.
If you're feeling stressed, he could give you a treatment.

Phil : Uh, we list at 1.4. We take anything north of 1.25.

Mitchell : Ah, that's all right. I have an appointment with Dr.
Bigfoot tomorrow.

Laura : Done!

Cameron : Okay. Here comes the judge.

Phil : Great! I got all the paperwork right here.

Mitchell : Reiki is a bunch of nonsense, Cam. That guy is a nut.
Modern Family Season 2x11 page.3

Cameron : You do this every time. We meet a new friend, they say
one thing you don't like, and you just write 'em off.
Mitchell : I do not!
Cameron : Oh, really? What about "but yet Rachel"?
Mitchell : "I'd love to go, but yet, I don't feel like parking." It's
either "but" or "yet," not both.

Claire : Phil.
Phil : I know what you were going for, but now all I can see is
"slow down your neighbors!"
Claire : Well, you're all wrong, 'cause this is incredibly clear. And
it's really important. We need to put these signs up all over the
neighborhood.

Cameron : You're lucky no one's kicked your butt yet. What about
Thomas? You wrote him off because he serves the salad after the
meal, which, by the way, is very common in Europe.

Phil : I don't know. It seems kind of cowardly.

Mitchell : What part of Europe is he from?

Claire : I called the police, and they were totally unhelpful.

Cameron : Pretentious-Stan? Okay, fine. Keep judging. Don't let
anyone in. I could care less.

Luke : Surprise. Surprise.

Mitchell : I think you mean you couldn't care less, because if you
could care less, that means that you care a little bit.
Cameron : All right. I'm going to the hot tub. If I stay in here one
more minute, my head is literally gonna explode.
Mitchell : Well, I hope not, because if you mean "literally"...
Cameron : I don't feel safe in my own home!
Claire : Phil, honey, I need your help.
Phil : With what?
Claire : What is the one thing a speeder can't outrun?

Claire : Mm.
Phil : Why don't you just make an anonymous call to the police?

Claire : Phil, come on. Are you with me or not?
Phil : Of course I'm with you. Who else would I be with? This
guy? I have no connection to this guy.
Claire : Good!
Phil : No! Fine.
Phil : Before you judge me, I have come in second to Gil thorpe for
salesman of the quarter seven quarters in a row. Seven. Nobody
remembers second best. Oh, yeah, everybody loves Michael
Jordan, but nobody thinks of Scottie Pippen. The only reason I
remember him is because he's named after my favorite musical.

Luke : Ooh. Bullets. A laser. Oh, I know... a falcon! Dad, jump in.
Phil : Not a good time.

Barry : Oh, hey, Mitch.

Luke : A laser falcon!

Mitchell : Hey. It's Barry.

Phil : That's awesome.

Barry : Uh, I just want to let you guys know you got a sprinkler
head that's leaking out there.

Haley : "Slow down your neighbors!"?
Claire : No. "Slow down"... Talking to the speeder... Who's talking
to the speeder? Your neighbors.
Luke : It doesn't say that.
Haley : Yeah, it just says "slow down your neighbors!"

Mitchell : Oh. Thanks, Barry. I'll let the gardener know.
Barry : All right. Or maybe I could just wave my hands over it and
heal it that way. I'm joking.
Mitchell : Oh. Oh, God. That was a good one.
Modern Family Season 2x11 page.4

Barry : Look, don't worry about it. As soon as I started talking
about reiki, I could tell you thought I might be a little nutty.

Gloria : Be careful with the bump! Hey, wait a minute. Who's that
guy? Jay, he's gonna grab him!

Mitchell : Was I that obvious?

Jay : Oh, no one's grabbing anyone. It's a neighbor.

Barry : You roll your eyes a lot.
Mitchell : Uh, no, it's true. It's true, no. I-I once saw a picture of
myself at a friend's poetry slam, and all you could see were the
whites of my eyes. Yeah, I looked like little orphan Annie. The
cartoon. Anyway, I'm sorry if I offended you.
Barry : No. Don't apologize. Look, I... Only thing that offends me
is a man who doesn't live in his own truth. And I appreciate how
hard you're trying not to roll your eyes right now.
Mitchell : 'Cause I'm about to pass out!
Barry : I see it.
Manny : Okay! I'm ready!
Jay : Oh. What the hell's he wearing?
Gloria : Protection pads. He needs more?
Jay : We're riding bikes. We're not training police dogs. All right,
kid. Come on. Get on. On board. Attaboy. All right, we ready?
Ride!
Gloria : Be careful, papi.
Jay : Ignore her.

Jay : Gloria, on the other hand, was a natural disaster.
Jay : There are three things you want to do before you ride.
Manny.
Manny : Check your shoelaces, adjust your mirror, and test your
bell.
Gloria : Okay. Shoelaces tied... The mirror is good... ...The bell is
ringing. Okay, now what?
Jay : Ride.
Gloria : Ay, no, no, no, Jay. Don't push me! I don't want to get hurt!
Jay : Trust me. I'm not gonna hurt you. You're a work of art. If you
get scratched the value goes down I'm making a joke to lighten the
mood.
Gloria : It's not working!
Jay : Let's just do this.
Gloria : Okay. Slowly. Jay, slowly.
Jay : Relax. You're not gonna fall. I got you. Put your feet on the
pedals. Now look where you're going. Look where you're going!
Gloria : No, I'm falling. I'm falling.

Jay : I've seen the kid fall down on that moving sidewalk at the
airport, so I didn't have high hopes. But what do you know? The
kid was a natural.
Manny : Mom! It's so easy!
Gloria : Bravo, Manny!
Jay : I told you!

Jay : Look straight ahead. Go, go, go. Pedal!
Gloria : No, Jay!
Jay : What are you ringing the bell for?
Gloria : Ay! Why you let me go, Jay?! No, no!
Jay : Pedal! Look where you're going! Look where you're going!
Gloria : I'm gonna kill you, Jay!
Jay : Okay. Good day's work. What do you say we hit the jewelry
store?
Modern Family Season 2x11 page.5

Barry : You're all set, Mitch.
Laura : Phil?

Mitchell : Oh. Barry. Mm. Oh, man, that was... that was great.

Phil : Laura!

Barry : Yeah? Oh. Namaste, man.

Laura : What are you doing?

Cameron : Namaste. Namaste.

Phil : Taking this...sign down! I recognized your license plate. This
is ridiculous!

Barry : All right. I'm gonna get out of your hair. I'm gonna grab a
quick tub and see if I can rustle up some food.

Laura : I know. They're all over the neighborhood. What kind of
lunatic does something like this?

Mitchell : Oh, no. Hey, don't rustle. We're making dinner tonight.
You're coming.

Phil : Who knows?

Cameron : Yeah, come down.

Laura : It's probably some bored housewife who hates her
husband and hates her life, so she takes it out on the rest of us!

Barry : Yeah?

Phil : Or things are so good at home, she's out looking for
problems.

Barry : Thank you, Mitch. See? It's working already. Namaste.

Laura : Trust me. This woman needs to get laid.
Phil : I don't think that's the issue.
Laura : Here. Stick this up. Send her a message from me.
Phil : Okay.
Claire : Hey!
Phil : Hey!
Claire : Oh, my gosh. What happened to my sign?
Phil : I don't know! I put it up, I went away, I came back... It was
in pieces!
Claire : This is so crazy.
Phil : Crazy!! Claire, this whole thing is crazy. Maybe we should
back off a little bit.
Claire : You know what, Phil? No. I am not gonna back off. Okay?
I am doing this for the safety of our neighborhood.
Cameron : Well, what's going on here?
Barry : Hey, Cam. Just getting rid of some negative energy.

Mitchell : Yes.
Mitchell : What?
Cameron : You know what I'm looking for.
Mitchell : He's a very nice guy.
Cameron : That's not it.
Mitchell : I'm sorry I made a snap judgment.
Cameron : Still not it.
Mitchell : You were right.
Cameron : There she is.
Mrs. Ko : Hello, Mitchell.
Cameron : Oh. Mrs. Ko. I'm Cameron. Mitchell's the other one.
What are you doing here?
Mrs. Ko : I just finished showing the apartment upstairs.
Cameron : What do you mean? What about Barry?
Mrs. Ko : Who's Barry?
Cameron : The new tenant.
Mrs. Ko : Nobody living up there. It's empty.
Cameron : But...

Cameron : Oh, well, in that case, we'll be back Tuesday.
Modern Family Season 2x11 page.6

Mrs. Ko : You see anybody up there, you call me. My husband. I'm
coming! You two so lucky they don't let you get married.

Cameron : ...that you're living in a dollhouse?

Gloria : The problem wasn't me. It was Jay. He's a very bad
teacher. Very bossy. I don't respond to that. I need somebody
gentle, nurturing, like a woman.

Cameron : Yes. Let's do that.

Phil : Hey. Gloria. What's up?
Gloria : Can you teach me how to ride a bike?
Phil : You can't ride a bike? I love that about you. I was beginning
to think you didn't have any flaws. Listen, I wish I could, but I'm
late for an open house.
Gloria : Oh.
Phil : Yeah.
Luke : I could teach you.
Gloria : Really?
Luke : Sure. I'm a great bike rider. I've taught a bunch of my
friends.
Luke : I never taught anyone anything. But my playdate canceled,
so I was wide open.
Cameron : Barry?

Barry : Okay. Let's not do this outside. All right? You want to go
inside and talk about this like two adults?
Barry : Great.
Cameron : No... No!
Barry : It's okay. I just cleaned up. Come on in.
Cameron : Oh, my God! You are living in here!
Barry : Shh, shh, shh, shh! Inside voices.
Cameron : Barry...
Barry : Uh-huh.
Cameron : ...Are you homeless?
Barry : Homeless? Are you insane? Look at this place.I mean...
Cameron : Okay. I can't even believe I'm having to say this, but
you can't... you can't stay here.
Barry : Oh, boy. This is about the... the body work I did with
Mitchell, isn't it? 'Cause I would understand if that was...
bothering you.
Cameron : No. You are living in a little girl's toy, and you have to
move out.
Barry : Okay, well, this is gonna make dinner really awkward.

Barry : Yep! Oh. Hey, Cameron.

Cameron : There's no dinner! Dinner is off! Okay? Now, come on.
Let's go.

Cameron : What are you doing in there?

Barry : No, no, no. Don't touch me. I don't like to be touched.

Barry : I'm just tidying up a little bit. What's up?

Cameron : You're a massage therapist.

Cameron : Are you living in our daughter's princess castle?!

Barry : I'm a reiki master. Very little touching.

Barry : What?! No, don't be ridiculous. I'm living in here, man. I'm
sleeping in there.

Cameron : Okay, Barry. Listen to me.

Cameron : You said you had just moved in upstairs.
Barry : No, I said I just moved in. I'm... I'm sorry. I thought it was
implied...

Barry : Okay.
Cameron : You're a very nice man. Mitchell and I like you very
much.
Barry : Thank you.
Modern Family Season 2x11 page.7

Cameron : But I'm...

Gloria : Mm. So how do we get rid of these bad thoughts?

Barry : You're welcome.

Luke : We shoot 'em out!

Cameron : I'm going to take your hand... Yes, I am. Don't give me
the coyote look. I'm not a canine. We're gonna walk out of here
together. Mm. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

Gloria : No, don't you dare!

Barry : Oh, this is not gonna end very well.
Cameron : Give me your hand.
Mitchell : Cam?!
Cameron : Mitchell! Call 911!
Mitchell : What's happening?!
Cameron : Barry's a nut! He's been living in Lily's castle!
Mitchell : What?
Cameron : Ow!
Barry : Hey, Mitchell!
Mitchell : Oh, my God! I thought he was living upstairs!
Cameron : Just call the police! Do you want me to stop and give
you the whole story?!
Barry : I never... I never said upstairs.

Luke : Ride!
Gloria : Don't you dare!
Luke : Ride!
Gloria : Luke, stop it! No!
Luke : I said ride!
Gloria : No, no!
Luke : Ride!
Gloria : I'm gonna tell your mother!
Luke : What? That you're riding a bike?
Gloria : No, that you're... Yes! I'm riding the bike! Whoo-hoo!
Gloria : It was the greatest feeling in the world. Luke was right.
There was nothing to be afraid of.

Cameron : Mitchell! Call 911! Stop pinching!

Claire :Get off the bike! Get off the bike! Give it to me! Give it to
me!

Mitchell : Okay.

Gloria : Ay, don't grab me! No, no! No, don't grab me!

Cameron : And just for the record, I was right! I still don't think
you should judge people! I said get off me!

Claire : Go, go, go, go, go! Go! Laces, mirror... Bell. Slow down,
jerk!

Luke : Okay, Gloria. What scares you about riding a bike?

Phil : Thanks so much for coming. It was great to meet you both.
Have a good one! See you later.

Gloria : Losing control and falling down.

Laura : How's it going?

Luke : Great. What else?

Phil : Hey, great. Lots of people.

Gloria : Somebody grabbing me?

Laura : Listen, I was thinking about those signs. "Slow down your
neighbors!"

Luke : That's weird. What else?
Gloria : Looking foolish.
Luke : Okay. See, all these bad thoughts are holding you back.

Phil : Oh, actually, I think they meant "slow down"... talking to
you...
Modern Family Season 2x11 page.8

Laura : Who's talking?
Phil : "Your neighbors."

Claire : I just overdid it on my bike, and I cannot get back on
there.

Laura : Anyway...

Laura : No problem. I'll give you a ride.

Phil : Yeah, um, you think maybe it's possible that you do drive a
little too fast in a residential neighborhood with children present,
maybe, or...

Phil : That's a terrible idea.

Laura : Oh, Phil, I appreciate your concern, but I am not the
problem. It's the crazy sign lady who can't put a sentence
together... That's your problem.

Phil : I wish I were one of those people who thrives on the danger
of leading a double life. You know, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker,
Hannah Montana.

Laura : Why?

Claire : Phil? Honey?
Phil : Claire?
Claire : Ohh. God. I had to get some water. I was chasing that
crazy maniac. I got so close.

Phil : That's a terrible...idea, because your bike is here. What are
you gonna do? Leave it? That's rude!
Laura : Oh, just pick it up whenever.

Phil : And you just gave up?

Phil : Whenever?! What's "whenever"? That's so open-ended.

Claire : Mm!

Laura : Oh, stop it. Come on, Claire. Let's fly.

Phil : That's not the Claire that I know. Get back out there!

Claire : Ahh. I love her energy. I'm coming!

Claire : Really?
Phil : Yeah!

Claire : So, why do you want to move?

Laura : Phil, I left my phone at the drugstore. I'll be right back.

Laura : Ah, I want a high-rise with a doorman.

Phil : Okay, bye.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Claire : Hey. Hi. I'm Claire Dunphy. I'm Phil's wife.

Laura : Besides, this neighborhood is getting a little crazy.

Phil : Let's not talk her ear off.

Claire : Oh, tell me about it.

Laura : Hi.

Laura : There's this one whack job...

Phil : She's got to go.

Claire : You know, don't say another word. I bet I know exactly
who you're thinking of. Yeah.

Laura : I'm Laura. Nice to meet you.
Claire : Oh, beautiful house.
Laura : Hmm. Thanks.
Claire : Hey, are you going by Greenleaf? Mm...
Laura : Actually, yeah.

Phil : Claire was furious. She said I betrayed her on every level.
So, I called the florist, and I have ordered one dozen mylar
balloons. Good luck staying mad, honey.
Phil : C'mon, which civilization invented the alphabet?
Modern Family Season 2x11 page.9

Haley : I don't know.
Phil : Yes, you do. We've been over this a hundred times.
Luke : Allow me, dad. I'm a great teacher. Who invented the
alphabet?
Haley : I...Don't...Know.
Phil : Luke!
Haley : I got soaked! What are you doing?!
Luke : Say it! Say it!
Phil : Luke, that's enough!
Haley : Oh, my God! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know!
The Phoenicians! The Phoenicians!
Phil : That's...right.
Luke : Teacher of the year.
Phil : She's all yours, buddy.

Claire : Honey, honey, look, look. She's doing that thing with her
jaw again.
Phil : Poor kid. She puts so much pressure on herself.
Claire : It's an obsessive-compulsive thing. I have read like 100
articles about it. Where does she get it from?

Cameron : I know. She's like a little junior junior Wells. Where did
you buy it for her?
Mitchell : I thought you got it for her. Oh, no. Cam, she must have
grabbed it from that store.
Cameron : Okay. Honey... Listen. Stealing is wrong. Now, we have
to go back and pay for it.
Mitchell : Cam, it's so far away.
Cameron : No, I'm not going back there.

Phil : Yeah, it's... it's a mystery.

Mitchell : Tracy?

Claire : I know. Alex... Honey, hi! Hi, hi, hi. Why don't you take a
little break?

Tracy : Oh, my God. Mitchell.

Alex : Mom, the test is tomorrow morning. I'm not taking any
breaks.

Tracy : Oh.

Claire : Just a little... Oh, okay.

Tracy : Wow!

Luke : She does that jaw thing every six seconds. It's like the
hippopotamus at the miniature-golf place.

Mitchell : Oh, Cam, this is... this is Tracy.

Phil : Ohh, I've bounced so many balls off those big teeth.
Luke : It's all about the timing!
Claire : Luke!
Phil : So close!
Alex : Stop it, you...
Claire : Hey, hey, Luke, go to your room.
Phil : Go on!
Luke : She's got to eat. I did it out of love.
Claire : Go.
[OPENING CREDITS]
Mitchell : Look at her with the little harmonica.

Mitchell : Uh, this is... this is Cameron, my partner...
Mitchell : And, uh, our daughter, Lily.

Cameron : Oh. "Tracy" Tracy.
Mitchell : Yes.
Cameron : Oh, hi.
Mitchell : Tracy was my high-school girlfriend. Yes. Yes, it's true. I
had girlfriends... quite a few, actually.
Cameron : I, too, took my fair share of ladies to the hen house.
Literally, I did take them to the hen house. That's the only place
you could get some privacy on a farm.
Mitchell : : Really? What were these... what were these girls'
names?
Cameron : : Oh, well, there was Nellie Forbush...
Mitchell : Oh...
Cameron : Betty Rizzo... Eliza...
Mitchell : Doolittle. These are characters from musicals. You're so
gay, you can't even think of real girls' names.
Modern Family Season 2x12 page.1

Cameron : Kim McAfee... that's a real one.
Mitchell : "Bye bye birdie".

Mitchell : Well, you know, that's what happens when you give me
Kahlua.

Mitchell : What's new?

Jay : Hello.

Tracy : I got married last year.

Gloria : Jay, guess who called. The Hoffmans.

Mitchell : Th... that's great. How long are you in town for?

Jay : Who?

Tracy : Just a couple of days. We're staying at my folks'.

Gloria : That's right. The ones from the hotel bar in Cabo. They're
in town for the night. They want to go to dinner.

Cameron : Oh, I want to hear all about Mitchell from high school.
Did he have a beard?

Jay : Oh, hell. The boring guy and the loudmouth?

Tracy : Uh, you're looking at her. Of course I didn't know it back
then.

Gloria : I know. I was so excited that they called.

Mitchell : But we should... we should all... We should all hang out.

Gloria : I know! So much fun!

Tracy : Yeah. Uh... no.

Jay : You're with them right now, aren't you?

Mitchell : W... well, take care.

Gloria : Yes! Ha ha. And they can't wait to see you, too!

Jay : I don't want to see them.

Tracy : Okay. Bye.
Cameron : Um... Thumpety thump-thump. Look at frosty go!

Phil : Okay, pencils down. You're taking a break.

Mitchell : That was weird.

Alex : No, I... I can't afford to take a break. Sanjay Patel's not
taking a break.

Cameron : Well, don't worry about it. It's high school, honey.
Mitchell : Well, actually...
Cameron : What?
Mitchell : At our 10-year reunion, we got a little drunk, started
reminiscing, one thing led to another...
Cameron : You went back?
Mitchell : I... I think I just wanted to see if I could. Turns out I
could.
Cameron : Where did this happen?!
Mitchell : Um, in the nurse's office. I can still hear the crinkling of
the paper. After that, I... I didn't return any of her phone calls, and
I haven't seen her since.
Cameron : You naughty little girl.

Phil : Well, obviously, Sanjay's parents don't care about him. Or
"her". What is that... "Sanjay"?
Alex : Sanjay's the only one in class who might do better than me,
and I cannot let that happen.
Claire : Honey, listen to yourself. It's just not healthy.
Phil : This is my fault. You see me achieve excellence, and it puts a
lot of pressure on you.
Claire : What about me?
Phil : Sorry. Yeah. It puts a lot of pressure on both of you.
Claire : Thanks, Phil. Okay, come on. Let's go have some fun!
Alex : No!
Phil : Let's go! Yes!
Modern Family Season 2x12 page.2

Mr. Hoffman : This is so uncomfortable.
Phil : Doesn't this feel good, sweetheart?
Claire : It's fun, right?
Cameron : Honestly, I think you're overly worried about Lily. It's
not like she's gonna grow up to be a thief. And besides, at the end
of the day, who does she learn her behavior from? Us. We're her
role models. Like mama always said, our children are just
miniature versions of us. Come on.
Mitchell : Cam.

Jay : No, no, but the beauty of it is we're never gonna see each
other again, so there's no reason to be uncomfortable.
Gloria : They're staying with us tonight. Their bags are in our
house.
Jay : Oh, then you were right. This is uncomfortable. This is
uncomfortable.
Cameron : Do you like it? The recipe called for a cup of water, but
I used milk instead to make the sauce creamier.
Mitchell : Cam, I need to tell you something.

Mrs. Hoffman : Oh, come on, Jay. Give me one smile. I know you
want to.

Cameron : You hate it.

Voice recorder : Oh, come on, Jay. Give me one smile. I know you
want to.

Cameron : No. You're right. I shouldn't try anything new ever.

Gloria : Isn't that fun, Jay?
Mr. Hoffman : Oh, this has been so much fun!
Jay : You know, I'm surprised to hear you say that. You've been
pretty quiet.
Mr. Hoffman : That's because I'm a listener. I love to listen. It's my
hobby.
Jay : Listening is your hobby? Sure.
Mrs. Hoffman : You guys have got to come out and visit us.
Seriously. We're not taking no for an answer.

Mitchell : Cameron.
Mitchell : Stop it. I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, today, when we
were leaving the mall, I saw Tracy by the fountain...
Cameron : Please, don't tell me you slept with her again. Did you?
You didn't. Right? You're joking. Yeah.
Mitchell : Okay. Um... I don't know how to say this, or... or if I'm
even right. I'm probably not. But, um, she was with a redheaded
boy, about 8 years old, which is the same number of years since
we...
Cameron : No!

Mr. Hoffman : Yes. Yes, yes.

Mitchell : And she said she'd only been married a year, and it
would explain why she was so awkward with me, and...

Gloria : Oh, we would love to!

Cameron : Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm-hmm.

Jay : Okay, let's slow down. You're nice people. We're nice people.
But let's be honest... We've all tried to do that thing where we force
a friendship that isn't really there. So why don't we just call it a
day right now and say goodbye, shake hands, wish each other
well?

Mitchell : No...

Mrs Hoffman : Oh, my God.

Cameron : Mm-hmm.
Mitchell : I know. I know. It's crazy, but, Cam, I need to find out if
he's mine.
Cameron : Mm.
Modern Family Season 2x12 page.3

Mitchell : Are you okay?
Cameron : Yeah. Yeah, well, you don't just tell your partner you
may have a baby with someone else and expect him to go back to
eating a delicious and inventive meal like it's nothing! Mm-hmm.

with people you actually like, not some bozos who glommed onto
you.
Manny :Tell me about it. I've got a clingy fifth grader I can't shake.
Jay : See, even Manny knows.

Mitchell : Okay, Cam, but even if he is mine, it doesn't change
anything between us.

Manny :I got your back, Jay. Thirsty?

Cameron : Mitchell, I need to have my reaction. Mm! Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

Jay : Can we just please forget about this now?

Gloria : Jay! They order a cab. Are you happy now?
Jay : I'll be happy when I hear a trunk close.
Manny :Hey, mom. You want a drink of water?
Gloria : No, papi. Not right now.

Gloria : Manny, go to sleep.
Gloria : And the worst thing is that you sold me out without
warning and made me look like a fool. Husband and wife are
supposed to help each other, not throw each other under the bus! I
would never do that to you!
Jay : Gloria... Gloria, wait! Could you get my book for me? I left it
downstairs.

Manny :You sure? You look thirsty.
Gloria : What's with you and the water today?

Mrs. Hoffman : There you are. Our cab is here.

Manny :It's a dribble cup. You can't drink from it without spilling.
I think it's going to make me very popular.

Gloria : I am so sorry.

Gloria : Ay, papi, why do you need these things to make you
popular? First the walking stick, then the business cards.

Gloria : Ay, wait. You left this.

Jay : Are they gone yet?

Gloria : Oh.

Gloria : Why did you talk to them like that?
Gloria : Quiet! They can hear you!

Mrs. Hoffman : In Cabo, you mentioned you were a fan of Gabriel
García Márquez. So, we tracked him down and got him to sign a
copy of "One hundred years of solitude" for you.

Jay : Oh, he probably already heard me. His hobby is listening.

Gloria : That's amazing.

Gloria : Jay, you don't treat people like that.

Mrs. Hoffman : Well...

Jay : What? I should do what you do? Pretend to like someone you
don't?

Gloria : No, no. Don't go. I really want you to spend the night
here.

Gloria : I'm doing it right now.

Mr. Hoffman : Jay clearly doesn't.

Jay : Can I tell you something, Gloria? When you reach a certain
age, you want to spend what precious little time you have left

Gloria : Jay doesn't know what he wants. I don't like to tell this to
people, but, uh... Jay's mind is... going away.

Jay : What? I was just being honest. They're boring as hell!

Mr. Hoffman : Not your fault. Well, goodbye.
Mrs. Hoffman : Oh, no, that's... for you.

Mrs. Hoffman : Oh, my God. No.
Modern Family Season 2x12 page.4

Gloria : He's so old, some nights it's like... he's not even here.
Mrs. Hoffman : Oh... Gloria, honey. Ah.
Mr. Hoffman : That's it. We're not going anywhere. Come on.

Claire : Honey. What would happen if the greatest scientists on
earth got together to mate nature's two most violent predators?
Phil : Are we talking about "Croctopus" in 3-D?

Mitchell : Hey. You never came to bed.

Claire : At 2:10.

Cameron : I fell asleep in the den.

Phil : Book it!

Mitchell : Cam, we need to talk about...
Cameron : Mitchell, wait. Listen. I was up all night, thinking about
it. And here's the thing. If you would have told me 10 years ago
that I would be living with someone and raising a beautiful baby
girl, I would have said you were crazy. But here we are. And you
and Lily are the best things that have ever happened to me. So if
you're telling me there's another kid, how can that be anything but
good?
Mitchell : Oh, Cam, that's... that means so...
Cameron : No, it's okay.
Mitchell : No, I need to have my reaction.
Cameron : We're gonna be okay.
Mitchell : Yeah.
Cameron : So what do we do now?
Mitchell : I don't know. I guess I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna
have to call Tracy and tell her that we need to talk. Okay. Um...
Cameron : Are you nervous?
Mitchell : I'm terrified. Yes. I mean, what's this kid gonna think of
me? I've been absent for the first eight years of his life. I mean,
how do you make up for time like that when...

Phil : Claire and I share a true love of cheesy cinema. Um, our
favorite categories include genetically engineered animals gone
wrong...
Claire : Old and young people switching bodies.
Phil : Mm. Uh, tough guys taking care of babies.
Claire : Any sequel three and higher.
Phil : Oh, yeah. Usually get a new cast around five... That's where
the magic really happens.
Claire : Yeah. Yeah.
Phil : Yeah.
Claire : Mm! Hey, honey, how'd your test go?
Alex : Second highest in the class.
Claire : Hey. Well, that's great.
Alex : Sanjay Patel edged me out by 12 points.
Phil : Oh, honey, who cares what she did?
Alex : It's a he! Sanjay is a very common Indian boy's name. There
are like millions of them.

Cameron : Okay, slow down. You're spinning out. It's probably
just a false alarm.

Claire : Sweetheart, it's still a great score. I hope you're not beating
yourself up.

Mitchell : No, you're right. This could be my "going bald" scare all
over again.

Phil : That's our girl.

Alex : I'm not.

Cameron : Yeah. And we know how that turned out.
Modern Family Season 2x12 page.5

Alex : Sanjay's dad's a surgeon. His mom's a professor. I can't
compete with that. I'll just have to do the best I can with what I
was given.

Jay : Actually, I want to talk to them, because I've been thinking
about what you said last night, and I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
You're right. You never would have done that to me.

Phil : Good for you!

Gloria : I forgive you!

Claire : We're proud of you, honey.

Jay : So I'll say goodbye.

Phil : She's such a good kid.

Gloria : No, Jay. Don't do that. First they think you like them.
Then they think you don't like them. Don't confuse them.

Claire : Yeah, she is. Did she just say she was gonna do the best
with what she was given?

Jay : I want to do this for you.

Phil : I don't know. I was still thinking about all the Sanjays. I
don't know any, but I know three Miltons.

Gloria : Jay, wait!

Claire : She's saying we're stupid!

Gloria : Ay, Jay, wait!

Jay : It's okay.

Phil : Well, she's... wrong.
Claire : Is she? Honey, look at how long it just took us to figure out
that she's insulting us. Are we holding our kids back?

Mrs. Hoffman : So, hey, how... how are you handling things, you
know, with Jay?

Phil : No. We're both bright people.

Manny :What do you mean?

Claire : Yeah.

Mrs. Hoffman : Honey, your mom told us that Jay's, you know, a
little off his game.

Phil : We're college graduates. We read. I'd go so far as to say we're
as intellectual and sophisticated as... Sweet! "Croctopus" tickets
confirmed!
Mrs. Hoffman : Oh, I just think that we should offer to take
Manny. Maybe for a weekend. Something.
Manny :Hey, guys.

Manny :A little? It's hard to watch.
Mrs. Hoffman : It must be so frustrating for him.
Manny :Well, he does swear a lot. You know, the worst is when he
goes off into the woods. Oh, and when he drives... Oh, my God.
Look out. I'm surprised he hasn't killed anybody yet!

Mrs. Hoffman : Oh, hey, Manny.

Jay : Hey! I'm so glad you guys are still here. I just want to say...
sorry for last night.

Mr. Hoffman : Hey, Manny.

Mrs. Hoffman : It's okay. We understand.

Gloria : Where are you going?

Gloria : Ay, you see? Problem is solved. Now go. You're going to
be late.

Jay : Got a golf lesson. My swing's a mess. Manny's coming with
me.
Gloria : No, you can't go downstairs now. You'll run into the
Hoffmans.

Jay : There's nothing wrong with you guys. You know, it's... it's
me.
Mrs. Hoffman : Oh, we know.

Modern Family Season 2x12 page.6

Mr. Hoffman : We went through the same thing with Steph's
father.

Phil : Well, that makes "deux" of us.

Jay : Now I'm confused.

Phil : All right.

Mrs. Hoffman : I'm Steph.

Claire : You bet.

Manny :Uh, here, Jay. I poured you a glass of orange juice.

Phil : See you in there!

Jay : Thanks, kid. What the hell? What's wrong with me?!

Claire : Phil, where are you going?!

Manny :It's always funny.

Phil : "Croctopus".

Gloria : Jay, go change. I'll be there in one second.

Claire : Honey. Honey! I think we should go see this movie.

Mr. Hoffman : Maybe we should get going.

Phil : Why do I have to watch a French movie? I didn't do
anything wrong.

Jay : Well, at least let me drive you to the airport.
Mrs. Hoffman : No, no. No, no, no.
Mr. Hoffman : Oh, no, no, no. We'll call a cab.
Claire : Honey, do you want popcorn or anything?
Phil : No, I'm good...'N' plenty. So hold your water 'cause I've got
some "twix" up my sleeve.

Mr. Patel : I guess we'll... see you in there.

Claire : Well, maybe Alex has a point. How can we encourage our
kids to have intellectual curiosity when we don't have any?
Phil : I don't know. It's two hours of our life. Fine. For our kids.
Sometimes I hate the kids.
Claire : I know.

Claire : You may be cool, but I'm... wine cooler.

Phil : I'm so confused.

Phil : I love us. Thank you.

Claire : I'm not. I love this.

Mr. Patel : Well, hello, Dunphy!

Phil : You do not. Name one thing you've liked about this.

Claire : Hey!

Claire : I liked the scene with the old man on the beach.

Phil : Hey! Who is that?

Phil : That was a trailer for a different movie.

Claire : It's the Patels, Sanjay's parents.

Claire : So he's not coming back?

Mr. Patel : Hey. Hey, how are you?

Phil : No, he's not coming back, and I'm not coming back, either!

Claire : I heard Sanjay did so well on his test today.

Claire : Some of us are trying to enjoy this film.

Mrs. Patel : Oh, yes, we're very proud of him.
Claire : Wow. Indeed. Yeah. Yeah.
Mr. Patel : Are you here to see "Deux Jour de la Vie"?
Claire : Well, we're not here to see "Croctopus"!
Mrs. Patel : Forgive Vish if you hear him groan. He gets annoyed
if the subtitles are mistranslated.

Phil : While Claire watched one of the most highly acclaimed films
of the year, I sat through a badly made schlockfest with absolutely
no redeeming value. And it was awesome.
Phil : Oh, my God. It feels like I have ink on me!
Modern Family Season 2x12 page.7

Phil : Bye. After you, doctor.
Phil : Sweetheart... Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

Claire : After you, professor.

Claire : What?
Phil : Honey...

Tracy : Mitchell, Cameron. Come on in.

Claire : Oh, my God. I fell asleep. I missed it.

Mitchell : Hi. Um, so... W... we need to talk.

Phil : Yeah, let's go home.

Tracy : About what?

Claire : I can't believe I fell asleep and you left. Alex is right...
we're idiots.

Mitchell : Do you mind if we sit down?

Phil : Claire, stop it. Look... Our kid got the second-best grade in
the class. Dumb parents don't make kids that smart. She got the
best of both of us.

Mitchell : Um, Tracy, I... I have something to say, and I'm afraid
that if I just don't say it all at once, I'm never gonna say it. So...

Claire : Mm.

Tracy : Please.

Tracy : Ohh. This takes me back to prom night.

Phil : Kind of like if you combined the jaw strength of a crocodile
and the ink-spraying capabilities of an octopus. You'd end up with
something unstoppable.

Mitchell : Again... sorry about that. Anyway, uh, I saw you
yesterday across the mall after we spoke and couldn't help but
notice that you weren't alone. Uh, you were with... I don't even
know how to put this.

Claire : But they did stop him in the end, didn't they?

Tracy : His name... is Bobby.

Phil : "Her". And she laid eggs.

Mitchell : Bobby.

Claire : Croctopi.

Cameron ; Such a lovely name.

Phil : Yeah.

Mitchell : Tracy... I... is he...?

Claire : Ohh.

Tracy : Yes, Mitchell. He is.

Phil : Hey. Hey. Check out Einstein over there.

Mitchell : Oh, my God. Oh... Okay. Um... Why didn't you tell me?

Claire : Well, that's just sad. Hey, Vish. You just do this.
Claire : Not in the least.

Tracy : Mitchell, you and I don't have a relationship anymore. I
called you after our little... visit to the nurse's room. You never
returned any of my calls.

Phil : I actually found it quite two-dimensional.

Mitchell : I... I was freaked out, Tracy, and I...

Claire : Hmm.

Cameron : Hey, let's not rehash the past... but rather, focus on the
future.

Mr. Patel : Thank you. So, did you enjoy the film?

Phil : Hmm. Well, lovely to see you.
Mr. Patel : Good to see you, too.
Phil : All right.
Mr. Patel : Bye.

Mitchell : Yes, yes. Yes, Cam and I, um, want to know if you're
open... to us... getting to know Bobby.
Tracy : I don't think that's a very good idea.

Modern Family Season 2x12 page.8

Mitchell : Okay, I understand. No, it might be a little awkward at
first, but I think after some time...

Mitchell : Please.

Cameron : We brought him a present.

Mitchell : Uh, Betty Rizzo.

Tracy : For Bobby?

Jay : Don't remember her.

Mitchell : Please, we just... we really just want to meet him.

Mitchell : Eliza Doolittle? Nellie Forbush?

Tracy : Fine. Okay. Bobby? Could you come out here?

Jay : These were classmates?

Bobby : Hey, honey. What's up?

Mitchell : Well, s... s... some were older. S... some were younger.
Uh, Liesel and Gretel Von Trapp. Sisters, obviously... too far?

Tracy : Hi. I wanted to introduce you to Mitchell and Cameron.
This is my husband.

Jay : Well, there was Tracy. Who else?

Bobby : Hey. How ya doin'?

Jay : I'm not an idiot. You played that record night and day. Why
would you tell me a thing like that?

Mitchell : Hey, what's up, dude?

Mitchell : I just...

Bobby : How ya doin'?
Mitchell : Good. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Hi. Cameron.
Bobby : Hi, there. Yeah. So, uh, how do you know Tracy?
Mitchell : Um, uh, how... uh, we, um...
Tracy : Mitchell took me to the prom.
Cameron : The prom.
Bobby : Oh, a redhead. You really have a type, don't you?
Tracy : They got you a present?
Mitchell : Oh... it's not...
Cameron : You don't need to...
Mitchell : I wouldn't even...
Cameron : You don't...
Bobby : "Li'l slugger"?
Cameron : I'm just gonna go and let you two catch up.
Mitchell : So... 'Sup?
Jay : I never realized that you ever had sex with a girl.
Mitchell : Oh, yeah. Yeah. I kind of got around back then, actually.
Jay : More than one?

Modern Family
2x13 : Caught In The Act

Jay : Well, technically, it was from you. But come on, let's hit the
road.
Gloria : It sended. Please come back.

Jay : Come on! Let's go! We're gonna need a little extra time at
airport security 'cause I'm pretty sure they're gonna want to patch
you down.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Gloria : Manny's with his father for the weekend, so Jay and I are
flying to Vegas.

Mitchell : We love our neighborhood, but sometimes the last thing
you want to do after fighting traffic is get back in the car to go out
to eat. And the only restaurant within walking distance is
Shawarma City.

Jay : I'm a little torn because I want alone time with Gloria, but I
also like rubbing Manny's head for good luck.

Cook : Two shawarma combo. Meat or chicken?
Gloria : I just need to send this e-mail to Claire why I'm not
working on the bake sale next week, but I can't say the real reason.

Cameron : Uh, one meat. One chicken.

Jay : Why not?

Cook : Number 32. Pay cashier.

Gloria : Because she drives me crazy when she's in charge of these
things.

Mitchell : Okay, that's not an answer.

Jay : Okay. We got a flight to catch, so let me help you out here.
Okay. You tell me what you want to say to her, and I'll help you
find a nice way to say it.

Mitchell : Then a miracle happened. Uh, the hottest new
restaurant in the city opened up two blocks away... Amelia's.

Gloria : I want to say... I can't work on the bake sale because
you're a bossy control freak that looks down on my cupcakes even
though your lemon squares were very dry.

Mitchell : And can you make the chicken all white meat?

Cameron : But there was a problem.
Mitchell : They can take us at 5:15...

Jay : Done. Okay? How's this?

Cameron : What are we, 80?

Gloria : "Dear Claire, I can't work the bake sale because you're a
bossy control freak who look down..." Very funny, Jay. Ay... ay...
why the whoosh? Where is... where is the e-mail? It sended! Ay.
Make it come back.

Mitchell : Or 10:45.
Cameron : What are we, 20?

Jay : I don't know how to make it come back.

Cameron : Then... miracle number two. Turns out one of the
mothers at Lily's pre-school is none other than Amelia herself.

Gloria : Now she's gonna read it, and she's gonna think it's from
me!

Mitchell : So we arranged a play date with her son, Jackson,
where we would, you know, charm Amelia.
Modern Family Season 2x13 page.1

Mitchell : Okay. The most important play date ever, so I'm really
gonna need you to sparkle, sweetie.

Phil : You were on fire, lady.

Cameron : Oh, I'm gonna sparkle like it's the 4th of July.

Phil : Well, forgive me for thinking your zesty performance
deserves some praise.

Mitchell : I was talking to Lily.

Claire : Really? You're still going?

Camerno : Hmm?

Claire : Phil, our children are downstairs right now, and they are
probably traumatized.

Alex : It's our parents' anniversary, so we're surprising them with
breakfast in bed.

Phil : Oh, come on. I'm sure it's not that bad.

Haley : They're impossible to buy for... we think. We've never
really tried.

Alex : I can still see it!
Haley : I can't believe that just happened!
Luke : What were they doing?

Alex : Okay. Ready? One, two, three...

Alex : Nothing!

Kids : Surpri... Ahh!

Luke : Whatever it was, it looked like dad was winning.

Phil : Oh. Oh! No! No!

Haley : It! They were doing it!

Claire : I'm sorry!

Alex : He has no idea what you're taking about.

Phil : Nothing's happening!

Luke : Sex?

Claire : Oh, my God.

Alex : Yes!

Phil : Yeah, our kids walked in on us. We were, as they say,
"having sex".
Claire : Oh, God. That's not a euphemism, Phil. It's exactly what
we were doing... having sex. In front of our children.
Phil : Well, they weren't there when we started.
Claire : No.

Luke : I know what sex is, Alex. It's when a man and a woman
take off their underpants and then get into the bed.
Alex : Stop talking!
Haley : Aah!
Gloria : Try Claire again.

Claire : Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Jay : I'm not getting a signal. Relax. We'll get her. Hey, shorty told
me about this restaurant in Vegas that's got a three-story wine
tower right in the middle of it. The guy who gets your wine flies
around on a wire.

Phil : It's okay. Maybe they didn't see anything.

Gloria : Like the "Peter Pan".

Claire : Sweetie, t... they screamed, they dropped a tray of dishes,
and then they ran out of here like they were on fire.

Jay : No. Not like the "Peter Pan". This is a high-end place.

Phil : In fact, you weren't even there when we sta...

Gloria : Oh, yeah, because all the finest restaurants in the world
have people flying around on wires.
Modern Family Season 2x13 page.2

Jay : You know, you used to go bananas when a Japanese guy
flipped a shrimp onto your plate. Now look at you.
Gloria : Try her again.
Jay : Fine. And just so you know, it's not like Peter Pan. I mean,
nobody wears tights or anything.

Cameron : Oh, you are funny! Oh!
Amelia : I really like you guys. I mean, I... I haven't had a lot of
time to meet the other parents. You know, single mom, hectic work
schedule...
Cameron : Now, what do you do, Amelia?

Gloria : Well, if they're not wearing anything, I don't want them
flying over my food.

Amelia : Oh, uh, I own a few restaurants. Oh. I just opened one
nearby.

Phil : Hello.

Cameron : Oh, my gosh. Are you that Amelia?

Jay : Phil, it's me. Can I talk to Claire?

Amelia : Mm-Hmm. Oh, my gosh! We've heard wonderful things
about the restaurant. It must be doing well. We can never seem to
get a r... a reservation.

Phil : Yeah. One second, Jay. It's your dad.
Claire : No. No, no. Can't. Unh-unh.
Phil : She doesn't want to talk right now.
Gloria : Ay, no.
Jay : Why not?
Phil : Uh, she's a little too upset.

Mitchell : Can't get in. Can't.
Amelia : Oh, well, that's no problem. The next time you call, just
tell them... Oh. One second.
Cameron : Oh, I'm sorry. Tell them what?

Phil : He says he wants to...

Amelia : Hello? Well, did you show it to him? And what did he
say? Okay. Uh, hold on a second. I'm... I'm gonna switch phones.
I'm sorry. It's the restaurant.

Claire : : Hang up the phone.

Cameron : Oh.

Phil : I'm sorry, Jay. She says I have to go.

Amelia : Excuse me just a minute.

Jay : You know, she's my daughter and everything, but that guy
seriously needs to grow a pair. Well, we tried. Vegas, here we
come.

Cameron : Yeah. You said to tell them s... something. Did you hear
that? When we know what to say, we're in.

Jay : Phil, put her on.

Jay : Only 'cause I want to.

Mitchell : Oh! This is very exciting. I've never had an in at a
restaurant before. They'll probably greet us at the door by our
names, show us to our favorite table...

Cameron : This is a... a beautiful home. I love the throwback to the
'60s.

Cameron : They'll let us play fast and loose with the menu, order
lunch things for dinner, dinner things for lunch! It's fine. It's fine.
It's fine.

Gloria : Turn around the car.

Mitchell : Although if this was the '60s, we'd be a couple of
"Confirmed bachelors," and Lily would be a yorkie.

Mitchell : Cameron!

Amelia : And I'd still be trapped in a loveless marriage.

Mitchell : Stop moving.

Mitchell : Oh, Amelia.

Amelia : You there? Put him on the phone.

Cameron : It's fine.

Modern Family Season 2x13 page.3

Cameron : Oh, that's the baby monitor. Should we turn it off?
Amelia : Who am I speaking to? Well... Mr. Campbell, you need to
replace the extremely expensive countertop that one of your
incompetent workers clearly ruined when he was supposed to be
fixing the refrigerator.

Claire : Okay. We need a game plan. We need to rehearse exactly
what we're gonna say because that is the only way I'm gonna hold
it together when my babies are looking at me with judgment and
disgust.
Phil : First of all, that's how they always look at us.

Mitchell : Okay, this is why she's so successful. She's tough but
calm.

Claire : Oh, Phil.

Amelia : Because I'm not an idiot! As is evidenced by my law
degree, which I will happily dust off and use to crush you in court
if you don't fix it, replace it, or send me a check in the next 72
hours. You know what? Stay right there. Don't move.

Claire : Honey, I walked in on my parents having sex once. It
was... oh... awful. I can't even get the image out of my mind.

Mitchell : Act like you weren't listening.
Cameron : What does that look like?
Amelia : I'm so sorry. I have to run down to the restaurant for a
minute. I really feel terrible asking, but do... would you guys
mind...?
Mitchell : Oh, it's not a problem. We'll watch the kids.
Amelia : Okay.

Phil : Secondly, this isn't as traumatic as you think.

Phil : Claire, we're not your parents. We're in much better shape.
Claire : Okay. You want to know the worst thing? They didn't
even talk about it. They just let it hang there. I'm not gonna do that
to our kids. Phil, this... this is a defining moment for us as parents.
How we handle this could shape how they feel about sex and
intimacy for the rest of their lives!
Phil : Claire. Honey. Honey, this is only a big deal if we make it a
big deal. We set the tone here. So let's just play it cool. Act like it
was a big, funny mix-up. Crack a few jokes. Lighten the mood.

Cameron : Oh, yes, you go take care of that fabulous restaurant of
yours that we cannot wait to try. And when we do call, Amelia,
you said to...

Claire : Jokes.

Amelia : Jackson, mommy will be right back. Okay. Thanks, you
guys, so much. I owe you big time. Okay.
Cameron : She owes us big time.

Phil : Well, this is... I'm just spitballin' here, but... what if I was all,
"knock, knock"... and they were like, "who's there?" And I was all,
"someone who doesn't want to see their parents doing it. That's
why we knocked". Again, this is... this is very rough.

Mitchell : You know, she also has that restaurant in Las Vegas
where the sommeliers fly around on wires.

Haley : Why are they still up there?

Mitchell : Did you hear that?

Cameron : Oh, my gosh. Lily, thank you for being such a trouper
with Mr. Personality over there. I'm gonna get you a treat. Oh, a
juice box broke in here. It's all wet inside. Will you stop gasping?
It's just a diaper...

Phil : Yeah.
Claire : What kind of jokes?

Luke : Yeah. How long does sex take?
Alex : Oh, my God. Stop talking.
Luke : Did you guys notice that dad had the same look on his face
as when he smells a new car?
Alex : I need to leave. I need to go to camp.
Modern Family Season 2x13 page.4

Haley : This is gonna be so weird when they come down. Let's just
go. Okay? Come on.

name's house. Um, from "Prizzi's honor". From... uh, oh, oh, she
was in "Addams family." You know, she...

Luke : Wait. But I'm hungry.

Mitchell : Anjelica Huston!

Haley : We'll get breakfast. Let's just go. Come on! Let's go. Come
on.

cameorn : Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Jay : Where are you going?
Haley : Anywhere.
Gloria : Where is your mother? I need to talk to her.
Haley : I don't think it's a good time right now. She won't come
out of her room.
Gloria : She's really upset, isn't she?
Haley : Big time.
Alex : How'd you know?
Jay : We called.
Gloria : Tell me exactly what she said.
Luke : I don't know. There was just a lot of screaming.
Jay : Where was your father when all this was going on?
Luke : Oh, he was right behind her.
Alex : Ugh! Ugh!
Cameron : Oh! It's not coming out! It's not coming out!
Mitchell : Blot! Don't rub! Blot!
Cameron : We are beyond blotting and rubbing. I think we've
moved on to sweating and crying.

Mitchell : Oh! Oh, my God. $50,000 for a rug?! Cam, we don't
have that kind of money.
Cameron : Maybe she won't make us pay. I mean, we wouldn't
make someone pay if this happened to us.
Mitchell : Did you not hear her on the phone? "Fix it. Replace it.
Write me a check". She probably has that embroidered on a pillow,
right next to a jar of human tears.
Cameron : Maybe we can turn this around.
Mitchell : How? It looks like someone bled out over here.
Cameron : No. I mean the rug. Maybe we can turn the whole rug
around, put it under the couch. See? No one would ever know it's
there.
Mitchell : Well, you know, we would know.
Cameron : Well...
Mitchell : What are you thinking?
Cameron : You don't want to know.
Mitchell : No, tell me, 'cause I'm... I think I'm thinking the same
thing.
Cameron : I seriously doubt that, because now I'm thinking it was
Joan Collins' house.

Mitchell : Okay, okay. Let's not panic. We'll just... we'll tell Amelia
what happened, and then we'll pay to have it cleaned.

Phil : Gloria, what are you... what are you doing here?

Cameron : What if it can't be cleaned, Mitchell?!

Gloria : They just left. They told me that you were very upset.

Mitchell : Okay, okay. Then we'll pay for a new rug.
camerno : Are you insane? This is a limited-edition alpaca handmade stark rug! I saw it in Architectural Digest. It cost $50,000. It
was in Diane Keaton's house. Oh, no, it was in, oh, what's-her-

Claire : Wait, where are the kids?
Claire : Oh, God.
Gloria : And you have every right to be.
Claire : It was bad.
Modern Family Season 2x13 page.5

Gloria : I know that. Claire, it was an accident.

Claire : W... what are you even doing here, dad?

Claire : That doesn't make it any better.

Jay : I don't think you should be the one doing the questioning
here, missy.

Gloria : Okay, you're right. I know how you feel.
Claire : Oh, God.
Gloria : It happened to me before, with another woman. And that
time, I was the one getting it. And it hurt.

Phil : Don't get mad at her. Your wife's the one who just offered up
her cupcakes.
Claire : Phil.

Phil : Wow.
Gloria : I'm sorry it had to come out like this, but you have to
admit that you're only happy when you're the one cracking the
whip.

Luke : Good thing we had mom's gas card.

Claire : What?
Gloria Come on, we all know how you ride Phil. But maybe if you
just let go a little, maybe even taste my cupcakes, I will join you.

Alex : Okay, I'm just gonna say it. Our parents are totally
irresponsible. And I'm not just talking about us walking in on
their... little freak show earlier.

Claire : No... unh-unh. No. No. I... I am so confused right now.

Haley : Just let it go.

Phil : I may pass out.

Alex : No. We're lucky to be alive. How often do they let Luke go...
go to school in shorts in the winter? And they let me ride in the
front seat before I was 60 pounds. And they never shut the gate at
the top of the stairs when we were babies. Do you know how
many times you fell on your head? Do you?

Claire : What are you talking about?
Gloria : What are you talking about?
Claire : The kids just walked in on me and Phil i... in bed. And
we've just spent the last hour holed up in our room trying to
figure out what to say to them.
Gloria : Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Can I use your
computer? I just need to check one e-mail.
Claire : Yeah, the kitchen.
Jay : Gloria, I just switched us to the next flight. Now, did you
guys get everything straightened out?
Gloria : Claire is very upset because the kids just walk in on them
having sex.
Jay : Aw, geez.
Claire : Oh, then we're all up to speed.
Gloria : She's so upset that she hasn't even had time to apply her
make-up or use her computer.

Haley : Don't make me regret buying you that lighter, dude. Put it
down.

Luke : No.
Haley : We get it... it was bad. But, you know, I... I guess... It's
better than having parents who fight all the time. Maybe.
Luke : My friend Jacob's parents are getting divorced. He has to
move out of his house. They told him last week.
Alex : That sucks.
Haley : He'll get used to it. Half of my friends' parents are
divorced.
Alex : Mine too.
Haley : It's insane.
Luke : So it's a good thing mom and dad still do sex.
Alex : Better than mom leaving the stove on, which she's done
twice this month.
Modern Family Season 2x13 page.6

Haley : I just realized we haven't even gotten to the worst part of it
yet.

Claire : Mnh-mnh. Dad.

Alex : Which is?

Jay : Hang on. This whole story makes more sense if you know I
got a thing for thigh-high boots.

Haley : They're gonna want to talk about it.

Claire : Oh, gross! Gross. You are ruining sex for me. And boots.

Luke : Well, maybe not.
Alex : Are you kidding? Their parents never talked about
anything, so they want to talk about everything.
Haley : Yeah, they called a family meeting when we switched to
1% milk.
Claire : I don't know where those kids are.
Jay : What is more important than putting a working lock on a
bedroom door?
Claire : You are one to talk.
Jay : What is that supposed to mean?
Claire : You don't remember when I walked in on you and mom
that time?

Phil : Hey. Working okay for you?
Gloria : Oh, yes. I was sending an e-mail to my brother in
Colombia.
Phil : Oh.
Gloria : Um, I was telling him about Claire. You know, I realize
there's so much I don't know about her. Like, for example, what is
her favorite word? Or what was her first pet's name?
Phil : Gloria, I'm not an idiot. Are you trying to get Claire's
password?
Gloria : Okay, fine. I sent her something by mistake. I need to get
into Claire's e-mail to erase it before she sees it.
Claire : Before I see what?

Jay : Gloria, can we please go now?!

Gloria : Hola, Claire.

Claire : Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm. So why don't you just get off your
high horse, dad. At least I am trying to handle this better than the
two of you did.

Claire : Hi, Gloria. Before I see what?

Jay : What did we do?

Phil : Whoa.

Claire : You made gimlets and went back to your room.

Gloria : Yes. Naked.

Jay : What were we supposed to do?

Claire : Mm.

Claire : You... you... you could have talked to me. You could have
made sure that I was okay.

Gloria : I was gonna send it to Jay. You see everything. The whole
body.

Jay : Want to talk about it?

Phil : I need to sit.

Claire : Yes.

Claire : Okay. Wow, dad. So, you just got done giving me a lecture
on the importance of locking my bedroom door while in my house
to retrieve naked pictures that your wife accidentally sent me.

Jay : Fine. Your mother and I were watching a particularly racy
episode of "Hart to Hart". Stefanie powers had to go undercover as
a call girl.

Gloria : It's so embarrassing. You see, Jay and I...
Jay : It's a naked picture of Gloria.

Jay : The irony is just occurring to me.
Modern Family Season 2x13 page.7

Claire : Mm. Mm.

Mitchell : We are horrible people.

Gloria : What are you doing?

Cameron : I'm only following your lead.

Claire : What I'm doing... is deleting it.

Mitchell : Yeah, so close that you stepped on the back of my shoe.

Jay : Good for you. Let's go to Vegas!

Amelia : Come here. Jackson's allergic to strawberries.

Gloria : Ciao!

Mitchell : What?

Claire : Do us a favor... no pictures. Oh, Gloria, listen. We do need
to talk about the bake sale at some point. I have some concerns.

Amelia : His throat will close up, and he can go into anaphylactic
shock. I need to inject him right now!

Gloria : Of course you do.

Cameron : Oh! Are you sure?

Claire : Yes.

Mitchell : He seems all right to me.

Jay : Bye-bye!

Cameron : Yeah, maybe just get him some fresh air.

Claire : What do we do now?

Amelia : Stop talking! He really hates this. And so I'm gonna need
you to help me pin down his arms and his legs, okay?

Phil : Okay, I'm really afraid of reading this situation the wrong
way, but I'm 80% sure you're coming on to me. Okay, now... 40%.

Mitchell : You know what?
Amelia : Jackson, honey, mommy's so sorry to have to do this,

Cameron : Mitchell, we need to make a decision.

Mitchell : Amelia...
Amelia : But it's only gonna hurt for a second. His arms!!

Mitchell : It was the perfect plan. Turn the rug, and she wouldn't
find the stain for years.

Cameron : Oh!

Cameron : But we couldn't do it. We're too honest.

Mitchell : Wait!

Mitchell : There are certain moments in life that define you, and
this is one of those moments.

Cameron : Wait! Jackson didn't drink the juice! I stepped on Lily's
bag and a juice box fell and we panicked because we heard you on
the phone and we can't afford Joan Collins' rug!

Amelia : Oh, guys, I'm so sorry that took so long. Oh, my God.
What happened here?

Mitchell : We are so, so sorry. We could not feel any worse.

Amerlia : Okay. Hurry. Here we go. One, two...

Jackson : Oh, no. That's bad.

Mitchell : Jackson did it.
Cameron : He grabbed Lily's strawberry juice and started drinking
it.
Amelia : What?
Mitchell : Before we could stop him, it was all over everything.
Amelia : Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

Cook : Number 19!
Mitchell : Yeah. Yeah.
Cook : Number 19!
Mitchell : Oh, uh, can we have some napkins, please?
Cook : All out of napkins. Paper towels in bathroom, Mitchell.
Modern Family Season 2x13 page.8

Cameron : He knows your name!

Haley : Totally. You talked to us on our level but without being
condescending!

Claire : And, uh... I'm just gonna say it... I'm really sorry about
what happened.

Claire : We did.

Phil : Well, we're... we're not sorry about what happened. We're
sorry that you saw what happened.

Claire : Ha! Yay, us. I think we really handled that well.

Claire : Yeah, okay. They... they get that. Let's see. Uh, no one
wants to see their parents... Shhh...

Claire : You were pretty good.

Phil : Your sensuality...
Claire : ...not dressed. Oh.
Phil : Basically, it's two adults.
Claire : Adults.
Phil : It's like you're shaking hands.
Claire : Mm-Hmm.
Phil : But you're not using your hands at all.
Alex : I can't handle a big family talk about this.
Haley : We're not gonna have a choice. So when they start talking,
just smile and nod and think about something else.
Luke : Yeah, it's easy. Just like at school.
Haley : Yeah.
Claire : So, I... I guess what I'm saying here is that as you get older
and... explore your sexuality, you will discover that as long as you
are in a committed relationship with consenting adults, there's
really nothing to be embarrassed about.

Phil : All right. I guess we did.
Phil : Me too. You were excellent.
Phil : Ohhh. Wow.
Claire : Ugh, this is such a weird day.
Phil : I know it.
Claire : By the way... happy anniversary.
Phil : It always is. Mmm.
Haley : Hey mom, can I get... oh, my God! Enough!
Claire : Hey, what's this?
Haley : Your anniversary present.
Phil : Aww.
Claire : That's very sweet.
Phil : My goodness.
Claire : What is it? A door lock. How embarrassing. Thank you.
Phil : We'll use it all the time.
Claire : Mm.
Haley : We thought the lock was a really good idea.
Alex : But the problem is... it makes a noise.

Phil : And let's face it... your mom can't keep her hands off me
whenever the gun show comes to town.

Luke : A loud noise.

Luke : Good one, dad.

Luke : It's hard for me to look at dad afterwards.

Alex : Ugh!

Alex : Humor makes difficult situations easier!
Claire : Wow. Really?

2x14 : Bixby's Back

Mitchell : Broderick! Uh, did you get any flowers today?
Broderick : No. Sadly, I'm without Valentine this year.
Cameron : No, for Mitchell! The flowers are for Mitchell!

Claire : So, honey, Ibiza can only take us at 6:30 tonight.

Broderick : Oh, that's right. Oops.

Phil : Great. I will meet you at Ibiza.
Alex : : It's pronounced "Ibeetha," not "Ibeeza."

Cameron : Mitchell's assistant has a huge crush on him.

Phil : Oh, thanks, honey. That reminds me... this weekend, I want
to see that baby panda at the "thoo. "

Mitchell : He does not.

Alex : Yeah... I'm the idiot.

Cameron : And I think the only prudent thing to do is say, "you're
fired. "
Mitchell : Don't be jealous. He just looks up to me.

Claire : This year for Valentine's Day, we're gonna have a nice,
quiet dinner at Ibiza. Last year, we, um... We overreached... A little.

Cameron : The thing about Mitchell is he can be naive. He is
completely unaware of how absolutely adorable he is.

Phil : We created sexy alter egos... Clive and Juliana... met in the
hotel bar. This one lost her panties in the lobby in front of her
dad... Which was hil... it was hard. It was hard for her.

Mitchell : Oh. Okay, well, thank you. But I am aware when
someone has a crush on me, and he does not have a crush on me.

Claire : You know I can't stand it when you use that word.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Phil : "Panties"?
Claire : Yeah... that. Yes. That word.
Phil : Sorry. She lost her underpanties.

Claire : I was a little concerned when they said they could only
take us at 6:30, but...

Cameron : So?

Phil : I know. This house is on fire, right? Now, this is how you do
V-Day.

Mitchell : So?
Cameron : Well? So?
Mitchell : What's happening?
Cameron : Flowers?
Mitchell : Is someone pointing a gun at you?
Cameron : Oh, for goodness' sake. Did you get the flowers Lily
and I sent you?
Mitchell : Oh, that's so sweet. No. No, I didn't get anything.
Cameron : Really? Did you check with that assistant of yours?

Claire : Except most of these people could have been here on V-e
Day.
Phil : But it's classy, which we deserve.
Claire : Yes, we do.
Phil : What were we thinking last year, acting like a couple of
teenagers?
Claire : I know. Oh!
Phil : Hey, we've had our crazy Valentine's Days. We tore it up!
But you got to know when to let that stuff go.
Claire : Yeah.
Modern Family Season 2x14 page.1

Phil : All those kids out there are just looking for something that
we've already got.

Claire : No. Phil. Phil. Phil. Don't hang up.

Claire : Yeah.

Claire : No, no, no. Not Claire. Juliana. And you're Clive Bixby,
remember? We met at the hotel bar last year. Now... Make up some
lie, ditch that wife of yours, and meet me at our hotel in 30
minutes. You think you can you manage that?

Phil : I love you.
Claire : I love you, too.
Phil : Oh, my gosh!
Claire : Wow!
Old Man : Are you okay?
Phil : I'm good. We're good.
Claire : Are you all right?
Old Man : This is my first day in one of these things.
Phil : Oh, hey, let me... let me help you out. How about I park it
over there for you, okay?
Old Man : Oh, thank you.
Phil : Here's your valet ticket. I'm kidding, actually. That's my
valet ticket. All right. Let's see. Lefty loosey, righty tighty. Hey! All
right. This is fun, Claire. You got to try this.
Claire : Phil.

Phil : Claire?

Phil : Baby doll, I've been lying to my wife for 16 years.
Claire : Okay. See ya. So... Champagne?
Phil : Um, actually, Claire, something's come up. So... Gotta go.
Claire : You're not ditching me here on Valentine's Day. Screw that.
Sit.
Phil : But... O... okay. We'll... we'll stay.
Claire : Phil.
Phil : Oh, that's part of it? So hot! Claire. I'm leaving. Deal with it.
So, no one walks anymore!
Jay : Should be just few more minutes.
Gloria : When is our reservation?
Jay : Here's the thing.

Claire : I know Phil and I are gonna grow old together someday...
Phil : This thing needs mirrors.
Claire : But today is not that day.
Claire : Hello? Hello, may I speak to Clive?

Gloria : Ay, no, not "the thing. " I hate "the thing. "
Jay : My secretary screwed up and didn't get us one. Don't worry.
I'll slip the guy a few bucks.
Jay : What kind of idiot messes up two Valentine's in a row? Not
this idiot. Two months ago, I booked a private chef, musicians the works... for a romantic dinner at home. I just had to get the
señorita out of the house while they set up.

Phil : I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong number. Bye-bye.
Claire : I got disconnected. Would you mind redialing? Hello?
Hello, Clive. This is Juliana.
Phil : Look lady, please stop calling me. This is...

Jay : This is 50 bucks. Do not give us a table.
Valet : What's the money for?

Modern Family Season 2x14 page.2

Jay : You also must refuse my wife. She's very persuasive. Just a
couple more minutes.

Haley : And I'm lower.

Jay : So we don't get the table at the fancy restaurant, which drives
Gloria crazy. "Jay, why you not be no more romantic to me?" We
walk in the door, and bam! She looks like a big idiot. And isn't that
what Valentine's Day is all about?

Haley : I know what to do. Dylan's been texting me again. I Bet if
David knew that, he'd come running right over here.

Gloria : Jay, come here. We're in. Your secretary didn't forget.
Look. Pritchett for two.

Haley : Stop following me.

Alex : Just a reminder. I need the television at 8:00. Jeremy and I
have a phone date to watch "Love Actually. "
Haley : That's the lamest plan ever, and I'm jealous.
Haley : So, my boyfriend, David, blows me off on the most
romantic night of the year... to study! This is the worst Valentine's
Day.
Manny : Best Valentine's Day ever! David stands up Haley, and
old boyfriend Dylan is out of the picture.

Phil : Just picking up some things. I am not here. Name tags, name
tags, name tags. Come on! Bingo!

Manny : Wait. Before you start playing these games, let me ask
you one simple question... Who is Haley Dunphy? Don't do it,
Haley!
Manny : Let me just say my piece. Look, you can be the Haley
who defines herself as David's girlfriend, or Dylan's girlfriend, or
you can be your own Haley. Maybe you haven't met her, but I
know her. She's an amazing person. So when you're ready, I'd like
to introduce you.
Broderick : Cameron! Is there something I can do you for?
Cameron : No. I just came by to pick up my man. I'm taking him
to Ibiza tonight.
Broderick : Ooh, I've heard good things about Ibiza. But I'm afraid
he may have to meet you there. He's in the middle of a meeting.
Cameron : On Valentine's night?
Broderick : I didn't realize when I scheduled it. It's my fault.

Haley : I'm not saying I miss Dylan, but at least he was romantic.
David never sent me a jar of his own tears.

Cameron : Gasp. I'm shocked.

Manny : I'm playing the long game here. Like me today, love me
tomorrow. She's had the romantic. She's had the intellectual. How
about all of that in one fine, little brown package?

Cameron : Oh, aren't you a dear? I'd like to mount your head in
my trophy room.

Broderick : I could drop him off at the restaurant as soon as they
wrap it up.

Broderick : Cam! Wait. Have I upset you in any way?

Haley : I've hit a new low.

Cameron : Oh, please. Let's not play this game. We both know
what's going on.

Manny : You can talk to me.

Broderick : Have I been that obvious?

Modern Family Season 2x14 page.3

Cameron : Uh, the flowers that don't get delivered, the Valentine's
Day plans that get interrupted... Do I really need to spell it out for
you? Me, Mitchell, wedge.

Claire : Well... Clive, I am just a bored housewife with a dark side
and an hour to kill.

Broderick : Don't hate me. It's just... So hard to see someone else
have something you want and can't have.

Claire : It's not a gift card. Or maybe it is. I'll be upstairs, Clive.
Don't take too long.

Phil : Is that what I think it is?

Phil : I never do.
Cameron : Does Broderick have a crush? Yes. On someone he
frequently sees at the office? Yes. Does that man have red hair and
a beard? No, but his boyfriend does. It's me. The... the crush is on
me.

Gloria : Jay, relax.

Broderick : This is you. Oh, did I validate you?

Jay : Nothing good on the menu. You see the hands on our waiter?
Looks like he's been birthing hogs. Let's just get out of here.

Cameron : Oh, yes.
Phil : Appletini?
Claire : It was. You're looking handsome as ever, Clive.
Phil : As are you, Juliana. You are hot enough to cook a pizza on...
in.

Jay : I'm sorry. The place is a dump.
Gloria : It's beautiful.

Gloria : I don't know what's wrong with you tonight, but I'm
hungry, I look fantastic, we're staying.
Jay : Five-course dinner waiting at home, and she's strapping on
the feed bag at Ibiza. But then an angel from heaven saved the
night.

Claire : I see the speaker business is treating you well.
Phil : I don't like to talk about money... but I have exactly $10
million... minus the cost of your next drink. Two. Just two
appletinis, please. Thank you so much. Yeah...
Claire : Why do I get the feeling you're not really a salesman?
Phil : Ohh... Pretty and smart. Or should I say "pretty smart"? I
might do some high-risk work for Uncle Sam that takes me clear
around the country.
Claire : Mm, so you could say you're a... national man of mystery.
Phil : Never did catch what you do.

Cameron : You took our reservation! "Pritchett for two" is us.
Come on, let's go! Move your bottom. Come on. Come on.
Jay : A big gay angelHello.
Claire : Hello, Clive. How close are you?
Phil : I am right outside your door.
Claire : Oh. Are you ready?

Claire : Didn't you?

Phil : Oh, I'm ready.

Phil : Surprising, I know. I'm usually pretty goo at catching things
from women in bars.

Phil : Well, maybe I should just shut them up.

Claire : I don't think you are, because I can still hear your pants.
Claire : I'll be out in a minute.
Modern Family Season 2x14 page.4

Phil : So... Will... I. Juliana?

Cameron : You just said he didn't.

Claire : Clive, where are you?

Mitchell : Well, I was protecting your feelings.

Phil : You have to come find me.

Cameron : He hugged me in the elevator.

Claire : Hello? Clive, I give up. Where are you?

Mitchell : Well, pick out China and move to Vermont.

Phil : I'm right here on the bed.
Claire : Phil, what room are you in?

Cameron : He said it kills him to see someone else have something
he wants.

Phil : Who's this "Phil"?

Mitchell : Yes. Yes. You're the someone and I'm the something.

Claire : Seriously, what room are you in?

Cameron : Okay. All right. Call him.

Phil : I'm in... 702.

Mitchell : Call him?

Claire : I'm in 226.

Cameron : Call him.

Phil : What?! Well, w-whose room is this, then? There's been a tiny
mistake.

Mitchell : Why don't we just go over to his house and stand on
opposite sides of the room and see which one of us he runs to?
Cameron : You get the check. I'll get the car.

Cameron : By the way, I need to apologize to you, I'm sorry I got
so silly with all that Broderick stuff earlier.
Mitchell : Oh, please, do not worry about it. Cam, I like it when
you get a little jealous. Cut it out. As long as we can agree... he
does not have a crush on me.
Cameron : Absolutely. So, to us.
Mitchell : To us.
Cameron : He does not have a crush on you.
Mitchell : No.
Cameron : Nope.
Mitchell : Why do I feel like you're hinting at something?
Cameron : Mitchell, we have talked long enough about
Broderick's crush, which he does not have... on you.
Mitchell : Oh, my God, what?
Cameron : Okay, fine. Since you won't let it go... your assistant is
hot for me. That's why he's been playing the saboteur.
Mitchell : And you're sure it's not because he wants me?

Mitchell : We are not going over there. And we're not calling him.
Cam, who cares which one of us he has a crush on? The important
thing is, I have a crush on you. And I wouldn't blame Broderick if
he did, too.
Cameron : That's so sweet. I... I wouldn't blame him if he had a
crush on you, either.
Mitchell : Good.
Cameron : "Good" what?
Mitchell : Just, good.
Cameorn : "Good" meaning we're done with this, or "good"
meaning you still think he has a crush on you?
Mitchell : Oh, Cam! The second one.
cameron : I'm getting the car.
Jay : Would you please just come in the house?!
Gloria : You had a whole year to plan, but you don't make an
effort. I am the second wife, Jay. Why do you treat me like I'm the
first?
Modern Family Season 2x14 page.5

Jay : Look about it inside. Where are you going?

Cameron : Let's go.

Gloria : I'm gonna take a ride. I need to cool down.

Mitchell : So we're really doing this?

Jay : Just come in the house. I promise you'll feel better.

Cameron : Oh, we're doing this.

Gloria : I don't want to go in there.

Mitchell : Well, it's gonna be me.

Jay : You're gonna like it better inside.

Cameron : I'm already embarrassed for you.

Gloria : Don't hold me back.

Mitchell : All right. Oh, wait.

Jay : I'm sorry about this, honey. I'm sorry.

Cameron : What?

Gloria : Jay, what are you doing? Are you crazy?! What are you
doing? Have you lost your mind?

Mitchell : Oh, it's a text from Broderick.

Jay : No, but you're about to. Happy Valentine's Day! What the
hell? Gloria! Honey.

Mitchell : "Mitchell, by now I'm sure Cameron has told you what
happened in the elevator. While I meant every word I said, I
realize how unprofessional I was. Please accept my resignation.
What you have with Cam is very special, and I would never
forgive myself if I came between you. Treasure each other.
Sincerely, Broderick." Oh, Cam, what are we doing here?

Gloria : I'm going for a drive.
Jay : I had a whole private dinner planned. I don't know what
happened.
Gloria : But I do. I know exactly what happened!
Jay : No, you don't. What the hell?
Gloria : I win! I see you sneaking around, trying to trick me, so
when I figure it out, I move the party over here, and I trick you. I
win!
Jay : What do you mean, you win?
Gloria : I know you think I think you're not romantic, but I think
you think I'm not smarter than you. So now we know. You are
romantic, and I'm smarter than you. And I bought you a
motorcycle.
Jay : Oh, my God. It's fantastic.

Cameron : Read it.

Cameron : I don't know. Maybe if some assistant's crush is so
important to us, it means we should appreciate each other a little
bit more.
Mitchell : Well, I can't think of a better time to start. Come here.
Oh... And the great thing about that text is we don't have to know
which one of us he wanted.
Mitchell : I know.
Cameron : I know.

Gloria : I win again!
Jay : Honey, I love all this, but you can't win Valentine's Day. I
mean, you defeat the whole idea if you make it into some silly
competition.

Cameron : I know.

Gloria : Shut up. I win.

Phil : Valentine's Day isn't over yet, Juliana.

Claire : What are you doing?
Claire : Sweetie, let's not push it. You almost got arrested tonight.
Modern Family Season 2x14 page.6

Phil : That's how it's gonna be? You're just giving upon?

Haley : Do you hear music?

Claire : I am not giving up on us. I am giving up on Clive and
Juliana.

Manny : Yes, and the fact that you hear it, too...
Haley : Is that Dylan?! Oh my God!

Phil : Wait. wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know a couple people
who could possibly save this night. Maybe you've heard of them...
"Two American kids, doing the best that they can... Phil and Claire
Dunphy.

Claire : Am I a bad enough parent to ignore that?

Claire : I am not going back to that hotel tonight, and I'm pretty
sure you're not allowed to.

Manny : You know, the old Haley would have...

Phil : Don't need to. Phil and Claire have a bedroom, which they
can turn into a hotel whenever they want.

Phil : You are. You're really bad.

Haley : I love you, baby!
Dylan : Haley!

Claire : But the kids...
Phil : They're not expecting us home this early. So, you up for a
little adventure... Claire?

Gloria : Salud, Jay!

Claire : Do you think you can handle it... Phil?

Phil : There's my back.

Haley : "I can't be the girl you want me to be, David. I can only be
me. Goodbye. Haley."

Mitchell : Oh, No, keep the change.

Manny : Send it.
Haley : I don't know.
Manny : Here, I'll help you.
Haley : No, no, no, no, no! Wow. That feels really good.
Manny : Because you're free.
Haley : And really scary. I haven't been single since I was 9.
Manny : That's why you need to take your time now... Really get
to know yourself before you make any decisions... Five, six years
maybe.

Ryan : Oh, thanks.
Mitchell : Did you put an extra tiramisu in here?
Ryan : Maybe.
Cameron: Ryan, again?
Ryan : I just like coming here. I tell you, if you were single...
Mitchell : Ryan!
Cameron : Ryan!

Haley : Years?! I have to call David.
Manny : The boy who tossed you aside on Valentine's Day? No.
You deserve better, Haley - a dreamer, a poet. Wait for him. He
may be closer than you think.

2x15 : Princess Party

Mitchell : Cam, Monica can"t come to Lily's birthday party
tomorrow, her mom's gonna be in Chicago.
Cameron : Oh, that's fantastic! What part is she playing?

Haley : It's so unfair. You told me I could go.

Mitchell : The city of Chicago.

Claire : I told you you could go if you got to be on your History
exam, which you didn't.

Cameron : Oh. Okay. Gun to your head... Which pair should I
wear?

Haley : I have a learning disability. The letters jump around on the
page and appear backwards.

Mitchell : Oh. Gun to my head. I'd say, pull the trigger.

Claire : Honey, we had you tested like six times. Trust me, I was
praying for dyslexia.

Mitchell : No Fizbo.

Haley : Oh, my God, why can't you ever let me have any fun?! Ew.
Ew. Dad, gross. Your hand smells like cheese!

Mitchell : C-Cam, the center of attention at Lily's party should be
Lily, not Fizbo the needy clown.

Phil : I didn't want to dirty a knife. Sit. Now, we all know when
Nana Dede comes to visit, your mom can get a little...

Cameron : I'm sorry. Excuse me. "Needy"?

Haley: Psycho?
Luke : Scary.

Cameron : What's that supposed to mean?
Camerno : Okay, w-why?!

Mitchell : "Why aren't they laughing, Mitchell? Why aren't they
clapping when I'm pulling the handkerchief out of my mouth?"

Alex : Drunk?

Cameron : It's 10 feet long with boxer shorts at the end. It works
on so many levels.

Phil : All true. Therefore, I need you guys to be on your best
behavior.

Mitchell : Yeah. Well, also, it's a princess theme party, so... I guess
you just don't respect party themes.

Alex : Don't worry. I'll keep to myself. I have to practice for my
cello recital.

Cameron : You did not just say that.

Phil : Ohh, fine. You know what? If it keeps you out of your
mom's hair, yes, do that. Luke, if your mom starts to lose it, I need
you to lighten the mood by being extra cute.

Cameron : Yes, it was. So? Can Fizbo come to the party?

Luke : No problem. I've got some stuff prepared. "Hey, mom, I'm
'firsty.'" Heh? Adorable, right?
Phil : Yeah, that's... that's good.
Luke : Don't worry. It works better in my jammies.
[OPENING CREDITS]

Mitchell : I'm sorry. That was... That was crossing a line.
Mitchell : No! No! You are Lily's dad. Just be there as her dad.
Cameron : Are you implying I'm not being a good dad now?
Mitchell : Well, if the shoe fits...
Cameron : They don't.They're comically large.
Luke: Hey, mom. Dad and Nana just pulled in.
Claire : Aah! Oh, wow.
Dede : Claire bear!
Modern Family Season 2x15 page.1

Claire : Ohh.
Dede : Oh, my sweet girl! Gosh, I forget that you're all grown up.

Jay : No, I didn't tell you to make the beep. I told you to say the
word "beep."

Claire : Yeah.

Gloria : If I say the word, then people think it's the beep.

Dede : You know, in my mind, you're still 12. Well, look at us... just
two old ladies. Ohh.

Jay : It's not the beep!

Gloria : We're home!

Dede: So, anyways, you'll never guess who I saw at the airport.

Jay : Oh, good.

Claire : Mm. Who's that?

Gloria : And we bought Lily a beautiful birthday gift.

Dede : Robbie Sullivan.

Manny : Yeah. I was pushing for a cashmere throw.

Claire : Robbie... my Robbie Sullivan from high school? God, I
haven't seen him in...years.

Gloria : Look, Jay. It's a talking storybook. We record ourselves
reading it, and then at night, Lily can hear our voices before she
goes to sleep.

Gloria : Then why even say it?!

Dede : Decades, really. I always liked him. And as I recall, the two
of you couldn't keep your hands off each other.

Jay : Terrible idea.

Haley : Oh, really, mom?

Manny : Unlike the timelessness of cashmere.

Claire : That's...not true.

Gloria : Enough with the cashmere! Why is it a terrible idea?

Dede : It is true. I read it in your diary.

Jay : Don't you remember the answering-machine message?

Claire : You read my diary!

Jay : Hi, you've reached Jay...

Dede : Well...Yeah. I-I read it because I wanted to see if you were
on drugs. It's called parenting, Claire.

Gloria : And Gloria. Please leave a message after the...

Claire : Mm-hmm. So, mom...

Jay : You didn't say "beep."

Phil : Okay, buddy. We're gonna need you on the front lines
sooner than expected. Are you ready to be cute?

Gloria : If I say "beep," then the people will think it's the beep.
Jay : No, I think they're gonna know to wait for the actual beep.
Gloria : I don't think they'll know.
Jay : Just trust me.
Gloria : Okay, fine.
Jay : Hi, you've reached Jay...
Gloria : And Gloria. Please leave a message after the beeeeeep!
Jay : What was that?
Gloria : You told me to make the beep.

Luke : Please.
Phil : Go get 'em.
Luke : Hi, mommy. My tummy's growling. Can I have some pasghetti?
Claire : Sweetie, you're hurting me. And take a shower tonight,
your hair smells like cheese. I'll get it.
Luke : Okay, I need a giant lollipop, and I need it now.
Robbie : Oh, there's my girl!
Claire : Oh, my God.
Modern Family Season 2x15 page.2

Robbie : Mwah!

Claire : Mom...

Claire : Robbie?!

Dede : Mm-hmm.

Robbie : Look at you!

Claire : ...I could use some help in the kitchen.

Dede : Surprise! I invited him to dinner!

Dede : Your words, not mine.

Claire : What?

Luke : Whoa. You came here in a limo?

Dede : Didn't I tell you she'd be excited?

Robbie : Yep. That's right, little dude.

Claire : Huh? I... Uh-huh. I don't know what to say.

Luke : Are you rich?

Robbie : Well, maybe a fuzzy navel wine cooler will loosen you
up. Sure used to.

Phil : Luke, that's not polite. Maybe Robbie isn't rich, but he needs
a limo because he has a lot of DUIs.

Claire : Ohh...

Robbie : Nope. It's nothing like that. The truth is, Luke, I am rich,
but not with money. I've got my abs, I've got my hair, and I've got
a super-sweet job driving that limo outside.

Phil : Hey, honey, who's this?
Claire: This is, um... Robbie... My boyfriend from when I was 17
years old, whom my mom invited to dinner.
Phil : Fasten your seatbelts. Phil Dunphy.
Robbie :Hey, Phil. How do you know Claire?
Phil : I know Claire from being married to Claire.
Robbie : Whoa, whoa, whoa. U-um... Wait a minute. Uh...
Claire : Mom didn't mention that I'm married with three kids?
Robbie : No. All she said was that you were still trying to figure
out your life.
Claire : Really?
Robbie: Yeah.
Claire : Okay. Mom?
Robbie : Dede?
Dede : Aren't we all?
Claire : Uh, no. Not really. Why would you not mention that I'm
married?
Dede : Oh, God, Claire. Not everything in a conversation is about
you.

Luke : Cool.
Robbie : It is cool. Hey, Luke, who's taller? Me or your dad?
Phil : Oh... I don't think we need to... I am just wearing socks,
buddy.
Claire : I just don't understand why you invited him to my house.
Dede : Because he's an old friend. What was I gonna do... not
invite him?
Claire : Yes. Yes.
Dede : Sweetheart, I don't know about you, but that is not the way
I was raised.
Claire : You raised me.
Dede : You're overthinking this.
Claire : Uh-huh.
Dede : I was thinking that it might be a hoot for you to see him
again.
Claire : And did you think it might be a hoot to ask me first?
Dede : No. If I'd asked you, you would have said no.
Claire : Of course, mom. Of course I would have said no.
Modern Family Season 2x15 page.3

Dede : Oh. And I'm the bad guy. Honestly, Claire, I wish I had a
tape recorder.
Gloria : "Once upon a time, there lived a family of bears. There
was papa bear"...That's you, Jay.
Jay : Ah. Okay. Let's see.
Gloria : Do you want me to hold it and stand in the driveway?
Jay : "Holy mackerel, this is good salmon." I feel like they missed
an oppor...
Gloria : Shh! "I don't want to eat the fish. They are my friends!"

Jay : Greatest news ever!
Gloria : So you're okay with this?
Jay : Well, I wouldn't say I'm okay with it, but I get it. I feel like I'm
in the same boat with your friend's daughter's first communion
coming up. I always felt like the husband never liked me. Maybe
you're right. I should probably skip it.

Jay : What kind of voice is that?

Mitchell : Wait, wait, wait. So Robbie Sullivan's at your house
right now.

Gloria : I am a bear.

Claire: Yes, he is having dinner with my family.

Jay : A bear? I was gonna get a crucifix.

Rpbbie : And let me tell you something. this chick was fat.

Gloria : "And then the baby bear said..."

Claire : Every time he opens his mouth, I can feel my daughters
losing respect for me.

Manny : "Good night, mama. Good night, papa. This has been the
best day ever."
Gloria : And after she kissed her parents good night, she drifted
off to sleep. The end."
Manny : Whoa, whoa, whoa. She? Baby bear's a girl? We have to
do it over. I would have played it totally different.
Jay : I think you nailed it.
Manny : And what's that supposed to mean?
Gloria : Manny, you're fine. But, Jay, I need to tell you something.
Jay : It's a bear, Gloria. I did the best I could.
Gloria : No. I don't want you to get upset about this, but I'm not
going to the party.
Jay : What?
Gloria : Yeah, it's because your ex-wife is going to be there, and
we're never good together. I'm feeling very nervous. It's better that
I stay here.

Mitchell: You know, I never liked that guy. He used to always put
me in a headlock. It is amazing the freaks we used to date.
Cameron : 'Ello, gov'nah!
Mitchell : I gotta jump. All right. Let's hear it.
Cameron : Sir Fizbo-lot, royal court Jester, at your service. I
understand there's a little princess 'oos in need of a jolly good
time!
Mitchell : No!
Cameron : Your 'ighness said that the clown doesn't fit the
princess theme. But "mefinks"... That a court Jester is right as rain!
Mitchell : There goes the theory that an English accent makes
everyone sound smart.
Cameron : Oh, come on. It's gonna be a boring party without any
entertainment.
Mitchell : I agree, which is why I hired a princess. Cue the gasp.

Jay : Wow. I... I don't know what to say.
Modern Family Season 2x15 page.4

Cameron : How could you do that? How dare you?! Entertaining
and delighting children is who I am.
Mitchell : Just be a parent.

Dede : Well, evidently not enough to keep you from sneaking in at
3:00 in the morning. I didn't know whether to punish you or make
you pancakes.

Cameron : But I want to...

Phil : Hey, hey! Ha ha ha ha!

Mitchell : Go.
Cameron : I want to...
Mitchell : Now. Stop.
Gloria : I was thinking about what you said, and maybe I should
go to the party.
Jay : What'd I say? I didn't say anything.
Gloria : About Maria Victoria's first communion. We cannot let
other people make us miss important family events.
Jay : What?
Gloria : I'm gonna miss Alex's graduation, all of Haley's
weddings, just because of Dede? I love them. They're my family,
too.
Jay : Whoa, whoa. Slow down. You're up to weddings already? Hh-how about this? Try missing tomorrow, and then just see how
that feels.
Gloria : Ay, Jay. You're so good to me. That's why I have to go.
You're gonna be there for me the same way I'm gonna be there for
you at Maria Victoria's first communion.
Jay : Wait a minute. That's back on the table?
Claire : Well, you know, we didn't want to break curfew.
Dede: Curfew?! Oh, right. As if you two ever honored a curfew.

Phil: Halfway through dinner, I told Claire that whenever she had
the urge to lash out at her mother, she should just squeeze my
hand instead. A doctor had to cut off my wedding ring.
Robbie : Claire, you remember that time we cut school and we
went out to the pier...
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Robbie : ...And we played that game, and you won the...
Claire : Giant panda bear!
Robbie : The panda bear... Right.
Claire : Yeah. Yes.
Robbie : Yeah. Do you remember what we did after that?
Claire : Yes.
Robbie : Hey, do you still like roller coasters?
Claire : Not this one.
Dede: You know, Robbie was a rogue, but he could charm your
socks off. Although I doubt he stopped there.
Alex : Wow, mom.
Claire : Mom?
Dede : We're all adults here, honey, pretty much.
Claire : Okay, I think we're... we're done.

Robbie : Your father used to scare the crap out of me.

Robbie : Yeah, well, I better get going. I've got an early-morning
run, celebrity client. Don't ask me who. Let's just say that if I'm
late, I'll be in Jeopardy.

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Alex : Who is Alex Trebek?

Haley : I love your stories, Nana. Keep on goin'.

Robbie : Uh, he's a game-show host. Why?
Modern Family Season 2x15 page.5

Alex : No reason.
Robbie : Claire.
Claire : Yes?
Robbie : This was incredible. Thanks a lot. S-so great.
Claire : It was so great.
Robbie : So good to see you.
Claire : I know.
Robbie : You look so good. Catching up was so fun.
Claire : Really good.
Phil : Hey, you... you take good care. You take good care, now. Yes.
Ohh, let's do it. Let's do that.
Dede : I'll walk you out.
Haley: Bye!

Phil : All those mother's day cards I sent her... All those joke emails she forwarded to me months after I'd already seen them.
Well, no more polite "LOLs" for you, Dede.
Claire : Oh! Oh!
Phil : Holy cow! Wow. Okay, well... You were right. It's not about
me.
Claire : Oh, God.
Girl : You are princess...
Mitchell : Stop eyeing the princess. You're gonna freak her out.
Cameron : I don't know. I-I think the whole idea of needing a
prince to come along and make you happy, sends the wrong
message, Mitchell. I really do.

Alex : Really, mom?

Mitchell : Really? And a grown man pulling boxer shorts out of
his mouth doesn't.

Claire : I was young.

Cameron : I'm...

Haley : I thought he was sexy.

Claire : Hi, sweetie.

Claire : Go to your room.

Mitchell : Hey, Phil.

Haley : Okay.

Phil : Hey.

Claire : I did it. She brought all the crazy in her arsenal, and I did
not crack.

Claire : So...Where is she? Where's mom?

Phil : I think a bone in my hand did.

Mitchell : Oh, no. I thought she was coming with you.

Claire : Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Jay : Yeah, let's get the weirdness over with.

Phil : You know what hurt more?

Claire : Oh, no, no. I haven't seen mom since... let's see... oh, she
made out with my ex-boyfriend last night.

Claire : What?

Jay : What?

Phil : I used to think your mother loved me. Apparently, she
always wished you'd married Robbie.

Claire : Yeah.

Claire : Oh, no, sweetie. This was all about her trying to annoy me.

Claire : Yeah. Yeah. And then she took off with him, didn't come
back to the house until after I was asleep, and then this morning
left a cute little note that said, "having breakfast with Robbie!"

Phil : Come on. She's practically walking you two down the aisle.
Claire : Ohh. Oh. He left his phone.

Mitchell : No, my God!

Jay : What the hell is she doing? He's half her age! Don't say it.
Modern Family Season 2x15 page.6

Gloria : I think it's sweet. Love is beautiful. It has no age. When it's
meant to be, it's meant to be. That is the question.

Mitchell : Stop. No, not... not now. The last thing I need is some
big scene, Claire.

Claire : Dad, what's going on over there?

Claire : You know, she's doing this just to torture me. Mm-hmm.

Jay : She was a little nervous about your mother being here, so she
tried her first Xanax, washed it down with a shot of tequila.

Mitchell : No, no. She's doing this to get back at me because I
didn't let her stay with us.

Gloria : Ay, look at the princess. It's so beautiful.

Jay : You're both wrong. This is about me. I got the young girl. She
had to get the young guy.

Cameron : Really? 'Cause I don't see it.
Cameron : Excuse me.
Princess : There's the birthday girl!
Cameron : Glitter? That'll settle in her lungs. So, I wanted to ask
what method of payment you prefer... Cash, credit card, check?
Princess : Why, princesses don't get paid, except maybe in
laughter and sparkles.
Cameron : That's nice. But I really need to know.
Princess : All I ask is that a little girl's birthday wishes... "Come
true"
Cameron : Miss, seriously, if you want to get paid, I need to...
Princess : Fine. You can make the check out to party stars
incorporated.
Cameron : Never break character. Never, ever!
Princess : But...
Cameron : "But" nothing. When I was a clown, my shoe caught on
fire, and one of my fellow clowns put me out with a bucket of
flammable confetti.

Phil : Well, she and I are good. We had a long talk last night after
you and I "split" that bottle of wine, and you "fell asleep" on the
stairs.
Gloria : I don't know why everybody's getting so upset about this.
Maybe it's about passion, about what the body wants, what the...
what the heart wants for the heart.
Claire : Dad, seriously, can you deal with Cheech and Chong?
Dede : Hi, everyone. Jay, Gloria.
Gloria : Oh, buenos dias, Dede... B-buenos... ...Mi amor bella.
¿Cómo está?
Jay : Uh, yeah. Uh, Gloria... Come on. That's enough.
Mitchell : Hi, mom. Hi.
Dede : Oh, Mitchell. Mwah!
Mitchell : Thank you for coming.
Dede : You remember Robbie.
Mitchell : Yes, I do. Yes. Hi.

Princess : What's happening?

Dede : Oh! That's Lily! Oh! I guess you're trying to keep the outfit
I sent her clean.

Cameron : Even as they loaded me into the ambulance, I
continued to make balloon animals!

Mitchell: So, Robbie, it looks like the years have been treating you
good, huh?

Mitchell : Flammable confetti?

Robbie : Hey, what's up, Red?

Cameron : There was a seltzer bottle right there!

Mitchell : Okay. Um...

Mitchell : I cannot believe it. She brought him to the party!

Robbie : I love this guy. Remember, we used to wrestle around all
the time?

Claire : Oh, my God! I'm gonna kill her. I'm gonna...

Modern Family Season 2x15 page.7

Mitchell : Yeah. Please stop. Is my baby watching?
Roobie : Good to see you, man.
Claire : I need to talk to you for a second. Let me just... Whoa,
whoa, whoa. ...Ask you a little something. What are you doing
with my mother?
Robbie : Hey, I've got a code. What happens in the limo stays in
the limo.
Claire : She's my mother!
Robbie : Look, I know this is all a little freaky, but I had a crush on
your mother back in high school, and it's always been kind of a
fantasy for me.

Claire : No, stop, please. She accused me of trying to steal my old
boyfriend from her.
Mitchell : Okay, fine, but make it quick.
Claire : Why does everything have to be so hard with you? Why
can't you just be a normal old grandma?! Why do you... You come
in here, it's some sort of sick game for you to just push people and
push people and push people and see how far you can push them!
And so fine... Look at me! You win! You win! I'm screaming at a
princess party, mom!
Phil : : Claire. Claire...
Claire : I'm screaming at a princess party!

Claire : Ew! You were dating me and fantasizing about my
mother?

Phil : Claire, Claire, Claire, Claire. Robbie? I think maybe, you
know, you should take off.

Robbie : Ohh, boy.

Robbie : Yeah, yeah, look, I hear you, Phil. Uh, but between you
and me... I'm getting some serious vibes from the princess over
here, and I'd kind of like to play that out. Oh.

Claire : What?
robbie : I think we both know what this is really all about.
Claire : Uh, no.
Robbie : You still want me.
Claire : Oh, my God. Are you insane?
Dede : Oh, what's going on here, you two?
Robbie : You are.
Claire : You're insane.

Jay : Hey. Time to go.
Robbie : Hey, Mr. P. How you been?
Jay : I'm doing good. But I never liked you in the basement with
my daughter, and I don't like you here with my ex.
Robbie : You know, your little intimidation game may have
worked on me when I was a kid, but I'm a full-grown man now...
And I think I should go.

Robbie : Claire still wants me.
Claire : No. Don't.

Mitchell : So much for keeping it all about Lily.

Dede : Oh...Oh, I should've seen this coming.

Cameron : Well, yeah, and I certainly didn't help by berating that
perfectly sweet journeyman princess like I did.

Claire : Oh, really.
Dede : One minute she sees I'm happy, and she swoops in!
Claire : Didn't swoop! I didn't swoop. If anybody swooped, it was
you! You swooped!
Mitchell : Claire, hush. Not now! Not now! Not now.

Mitchell : Oh, God, look at this place. Everybody's traumatized.
Oh, we need somebody to pump some life back into this party,
huh?
Camerno : I got this. I'll go in and turn on some music, bring out
the cupcakes, pump up the bubble machine.
Modern Family Season 2x15 page.8

Mitchell : Or...

Jay : I told you it was about me!

Cameron : Is that a roundabout way of saying a certain clown can
come to the party?

Gloria: No! No!
Phil : I got Gloria! I got Gloria!

Mitchell : I was wrong. Every kid wants a clown for a dad.
Cameron : Oh! You just made a little girl very happy.

Cameron : This is such a precious gift!

Mitchell : Yes, well, I can see that.

Mitchell : I know. I can't believe my dad sat down and did this.
Cameron : Keep going.

Jay : You okay?

Gloria : Jay, pay attention. It's your line!

Dede : I'm fine. I will be fine.

Jay : I just had a damn line. Manny, freshen this up for me.

Jay : 'Cause you know Claire gets stressed out. That stuff she said
out there...

Gloria : No, no more drinks until we finish this.

Dede : Was all true.
Jay : Yeah.

Jay : Who cares? Cam's just gonna return it anyway.
Mitchell : Cue gasp.

Dede : I don't know what I was thinking with him. I feel like such
a fool.
Jay : You got flattered by the attention of a younger guy, and you
got a little carried away. So what?
Dede : It's not that. It's... I divorced you, because I was looking for
something else. I haven't found it. But when I come back here, I
feel like I have to prove something. Like people are looking at me,
saying, "You broke up the family. What do you have to show for
it?"
Jay : You did the right thing. We were stalled. I didn't have the
guts to end it.
Dede : That's because you're a decent man. And that doesn't make
it any easier. I just don't want to be thought of as "Crazy Nana."
That's not really who I am. I think, more than anything else, my
real problem... is her!
Gloria : Huh? No, Dede! Ay, ¿qué pasa? Oh. Ha ha.
Claire : So, maybe it isn't about me?
Mitchell : Or me.

2x16 : Regrets Only
Phil : Morning.
Claire : Hey.
Phil : Did you sleep all right?
Claire : No. You? Say no, Phil.
Phil : Of course no. I missed you up there.
Claire : Last night, I know I got kind of carried away...
Phil : No, no, no. You don't need to apologize.
Claire : I don't think that I was apologi...
Phil : You were right to be mad.
Claire : Sometimes I just feel like I have to scream to let you know
how upset I am, but you get it now, right?
Phil : I... do.
Phil : Not. No idea whatsoever. Ohh, if I knew, but... no.
Claire : Good. So let's pretend the whole thing never happened.
Phil : What were we even fighting about, huh?
Luke : What the heck happened in here? The raccoon get through
the dog door again?
Phil : Yep. The raccoon got in, and your mom fought it off with the
fire extinguisher.
Luke : You're a mess! Are you okay?
Phil : Careful, buddy. Not today. I think you look beautiful.
Claire : Save it.

Jay : One time I forgot to get Gloria a birthday present, and I paid
for it. Another time I remembered, but she didn't like the gift. I
paid for that. So you'd think when I remember to buy her a gift
and she loves it, I wouldn't have to pay for it, right?
[OPENING CREDITS]
Cameron : Oh, hey, good. Grab the other end of this and help me
get it out of here. I have to start setting up the chairs for tonight.
Mitchell : Oh, tonight? What's tonight?
Cameron : Are you kidding me? This is what I'm talking about,
Mitchell. You never listen when I...
Mitchell : It's a fundraiser for the friends of the Third Street
Overpass Music Society. Two harpists are performing, and you're
anxious 'cause Andrew, your nemesis from the steering committee,
ran the event last year, and you want to upstage him. I was
kidding.
Cameron : Ha.
Mitchell : Cam has it in his head that I don't listen to him, but I do.
Cameron : Do you, Mitchell? Do you?
Cameron : The doctor called and said Lily's rash is just dry skin.
I'm so relieved. What did I just say?
Mitchell : You act like you listen to every single thing that I say,
but you don't.
Cameron : Don't I, Mitchell?
Cameron : Hey, I'm going to the store today. Do you need me to
pick anything up for you?...
Modern Family Season 2x16 page.1

Cameron : Razor blades, saline solution, black socks, and the new
issue of Vanity Fair.

Phil : Not, if I can possibly avoid it. Claire has this little... habit...
At the mall, where sh... I can't even talk about it.

Mitchell : Wow. I don't even remember asking for all that. Thank
you.

Gloria : Jay, come on! I want to go home because you said you
were going to film me doing the karaoke so I can send it to
Colombia to my mother.

Cameron : Don't I?

Phil : Claire, um, about the mall? I was actually gonna run out and
get my hair cut this afternoon.

Jay : How'd this thing come off, anyway?
Claire : Well, I was cooking dinner, and...
Phil : Right. And the raccoon just walked in the...
Claire : And I already had the door open.

Jay : Well, hang on here. Why don't I run Claire down the mall,
and you give Phil a haircut? You're always talking about how you
miss working at the salon.
Gloria : I guess I could. I do Jay. Why can't I do you?

Phil : Right. Which I... I had already had ahold of the...

Phil : You... can do me. Okay, let's get this party started. You know
that song?

Jay : Why don't you two go work on your story and come back?

Jay : Let's go, let's go! We're wasting time!

Phil : Okay. Okay.

Phil : O... okay, okay. Yeah.

Haley : I won't be home till late. I have another shift at the
restaurant.

Gloria : You know it?

Phil : That's our working girl. Let the river run, honey.
Haley : Check it! $57 in tips from last night. Holla!
Claire : Honey, that's impressive. You know what? $57 from you,
$57 from us... You keep this up, we are going to be buying you a
car by the summer.
Luke : Mom, is this "upscale casual"?

Phil : I think I do.
Cameron : So, that was Andrew, who practically choked telling me
that no one had called in their regrets for the event tonight. It is
gonna be a full house.
Mitchell : Oh, that must feel great!

Claire : What?

Cameron : Oh, I never thought I would enjoy having an
archenemy. - Oh. But I do, Mitchell. I do. Hmm.

Phil : Oh, yeah. Cam hired Luke to help out with the benefit
tonight.

Mitchell : Hey, Lily, what you got there?

Jay : Hey, you know what? I can't fix this thing.
Claire : What? I need that. I use it every day. Okay, Phil, what do
you say? You want to take a trip to the mall with me?
Phil : I... do.

Cameron : I do feel bad for those PETA folks. Their event's
tonight, too. That's why I had you mail the invitations so long ago.
I shouldn't laugh. I do feel bad for those little PETA animals. I
really do. What are you doing?
Mitchell : Nothing. She was, uh... she was, uh, sucking her thumb
again.
Modern Family Season 2x16 page.2

Andrew : I'll see you at 7:00.
Mitchell : Yes, I put Cam's invites in my car to take them to the
post office and then threw my gym bag on top of them and
completely forgot they existed. Ohh, I feel terrible. Haven't been to
the gym in six weeks. And I ruined Cam's event.
Mitchell : Hello, Miss Hartwick. Uh, Cam and I are hosting a little
event tonight, and... Yes, yes. No, I am aware that there is also a
PETA event, and... ohh.
Cameron : Who are you talking to?

Cameron : Drive safely. What did I tell you?
Luke : She's even worse than you said.
Gloria : Hold still! You can't move like that. It's like cutting the
hair of a cuckoo bird.
Phil : I'm sorry. I'm just a little tense today.
Gloria : I knew it. Something happened. Because when somebody
works in a salon, they know when someone needs to talk.

Cameron : Luke, how are those chairs coming? Come in.

Phil : Actually, you might be able to help me with this one. Claire
and I got into a huge fight last night... And I'm not even sure what
it was about.

Luke : I think you should come in come in.

Gloria : Was that why you didn't want to go to the mall with her?

Cameron : Oh, now I'm worried about the flow. The eyes should
go to the harps, not the backs of chairs.

Phil : Oh. No, that was... more about a weird... mall habit Claire
has.

Mitchell : I'm in the shower!

Luke : Are you gonna get upset and starting eating all the
appetizers again?
Cameron : It is amazing what you notice and what you don't
notice. Please handle that. I need to think.

Claire : Oh, my god! That's good! Oh, oh! Go low, go low. Go low,
go low. Oh! Oh! Oh, my god! Dad! Dad! You got to get one of
these! Oh! Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

Luke : Come on, Luke.
Waitress : Hi, there. Your father home?
Luke : I think so. Why?
Cameron : Oh, oh! The wait staff. Please, Luke, show them to the
kitchen, please.
andrew : Knock knock.
Cameron : Oh. Hello, Andrew.

Alex : It is impressive how much Haley's earning. She's over $500
already.
Manny : That's a lot of cheddar.
alex : Why's everyone acting like she's the first 17-year-old to have
a job? In other cultures, she'd have two kids already, and they'd
have jobs.

Andrew : Nice chair backs. I just thought you could use this. It's
the sign-in book for my event last year. Let just turn to the blank
pages, which should be... Oh. No. It's full.

Manny : You know, I stopped by the restaurant a couple times,
and she wasn't there.

Cameron : Oh, well, thank you for thinking of us, but shouldn't
you be getting back home to Donald? That is the name of your cat,
isn't it?

Manny : Uh, I don't remember. I was at the mall for a movie.

Alex : When?
Alex : Think! I need details!
Modern Family Season 2x16 page.3

Manny : Okay, it was a romantic comedy my now ex-friend
Reuben recommended...

Claire : "Uh..."

Alex : Not about the movie! What day?! Focus!

Claire : "Was it..."

Manny : Okay, uh, it was Tuesday, but I also ate there again on
Saturday, and she wasn't there then, either.

Phil : Uh...

Phil : Was it...

Alex : Oh, my god. I bet she doesn't even work there.

Claire : "Uh"? No, Phil. No. No, no, no. No! I'm going to get some
air.

Manny : Well, then, where's all this money coming from?

Phil : Claire. Claire!

Alex : Do you notice how every single night is just under $60?
Grandpa gave her $60 for her birthday. She's just hanging around
the mall all day, flashing the same cash every night, and fooling
my parents into buying her a car. Hey, dad! Can we eat at Haley's
restaurant tonight?!

Claire : No! Don't follow me.

Phil : Hey, there's a good idea!

Claire : Mm.

Alex : Great. I'll text her.

Jay : Where'd you go?

Phil : Happy valen-birth-iversary!
Jay : Storming off... right out of your mom's playbook.

Claire : Well, as it turns out, not very far.
Haley : Oh, god, no!
Claire : Oh, god, yes! Oh! Oh, god, yes! Oh, get after it! Ohh!
Amazing. I'm going for 15 more on me.

Claire : Phil! Phil, you moron, stop it! It's me, you idiot!

Jay : I think you got what you needed from that.

Claire : What are you doing?!

Claire : Oh. Okay. Thank you.

Phil : I'm sorry! I thought you were a raccoon!

Jay : You know, maybe you do need to talk about this fight.

Claire : You thought I was a raccoon! Because people look so
much like raccoons. Oh, look. There's one now!

Claire : With Phil?

Phil : I'm sorry!

Phil : No, Claire, no! Claire!
Gloria : How could you not know what she was mad about?
Phil : Because she didn't tell me. She just freaked out.
Claire : I cannot believe you, Phil! How could you?!
Phil : What is happening? What... what did I do?
Claire : Are you serious? You are! You don't know. We've had this
conversation a hundred times. You know... no, no. I'm not... I'm
not doing this again. You tell me what you did.
Phil : Uh...

Gloria : Wait a minute. Not even crazy woman go crazy for no
reason. What happened before the broccoli?
Phil : That's just it... it came out of the blue. I walked in the door,
we're having a conversation about nothing.
Phil : Hey, honey.
Claire : Hi.
Modern Family Season 2x16 page.4

Phil : Sorry I got stuck at the office. How was your day?
Claire : It was good. Although you know what?
Phil : What?

Phil : I almost forgot. I picked up the broccoli you asked for.
Cauliflower. Can't believe I did that again.

Claire : Debbie stood me up for lunch. Rude, right?

Claire : I cannot believe you, Phil!

Phil : No. She called.
Claire : I didn't get a message.
Phil : Yeah. You did. I left you one. It's right... there.
Gloria : That's it! How is she supposed to see this? If you give me
a message this tiny, I kill you.
Phil : But that's not when she got mad.
Phil : Also, I talked to the insurance company about that little
accident that "wasn't your fault" because the brakes weren't
"working right." And that's not gonna cost us as much money as I
thought, so that's good.
Gloria : That's it! You insult a woman's driving, and you use the
"Air bunnies." You do that to me, and I kill you.
Phil : I hear you, but the screaming still hadn't started yet.
Phil : So, I'm having lunch with Skip Woosnum, right? Boy, can
that guy go on and on. Tangent after tangent. By the way, turned
me on to the greatest thing... wedge salad... you go to try it.
Anyhoo... Guess who's sitting at the table next to us. My old
girlfriend Carla. Yeah! We're gonna grab coffee. She lost a ton of
weight.
Gloria : How stupid are you? You tell me that you're seeing an old
girlfriend, and I...
Phil : Kill me, I know. But she still hadn't snapped yet.

Gloria : You didn't do one thing wrong. You do everything wrong!
I don't even know why she talks to you.
Phil : She said she was okay.
Gloria : No. No woman is okay with this. We don't forget. We
wait. And then, when you least expect it, We make you pay. Chin
up!
Phil : Ohh.
Gloria : Up!
Jay : So you had a meltdown over that.
Claire : I did, because ever since I met him, I've been trying to get
Phil to try a wedge salad. The minute that Skip Woosnum, whom
he doesn't even like, suggests it, Phil thinks it's the greatest thing
ever, and he does this with everything. He does it with books,
with movies, with TV. He listens to everybody's opinion but mine,
and it drives me crazy.
Jay : You two seemed fine this morning.
Claire : Well, we were because we talked about it, which, by the
way, if you want this whole karaoke thing with Gloria to go away,
that's what you need to do.
Jay : That's easier said than done.
Claire : Well, since when do you shy away from confrontation, Mr.
Tough Talk, Mr. Straight Shooter? Getting a little soft, grandpa?
Jay : You know, when you get a massage, you sound like a Tijuana
prostitute.
Cameron : Luke, phone.
Modern Family Season 2x16 page.5

Luke : Friends of the Third Street...

Alex : Yeah, we're all proud. So where's our table?

Cameron : Is that Mitchell? What's taking him?

Haley : Actually, bad news. We're totally booked. We have a ton of
reservations.

Luke : No, it's not Mitchell. It's... I don't understand his name.
Cameron : Hello? Oh, hi, Longinus. Listen, did you get my
message? About the chiavari chairs... I want you to bring them
when you come. What do you mean you're not... not coming?
Well, that's not possible. Mitch... Mitch mailed them weeks ago.
What about Pepper? Did he get his? And L'Michael? And Steven
and Stefan? And Bob? I have to go. Get me your uncle Mitchell.
Luke : I don't know his number. It went to voicemail.
Cameron : Of course it did. Keep trying him until you get him. It's
one button. Just... redial.
Mitchell : Hey, really great event tonight benefiting the music
society... musicians like you. Okay. Hey!
Luke : Uncle Cam for uncle Mitchell.
Cameron : How could you, Mitchell?! Honestly! Give me that. You
want to hear the guest list for night? So far it's anger, betrayal,
terror, and sadness. Congratulations, Mitchell, you packed the
house!
Mitchell : Cam, I am so sorry. I... I... I'm gonna fix it. I'll make a big
donation.
Cameron : That's not gonna keep them from kicking me off the
steering committee! When Andrew walks in here and sees a room
full of empty chairs...
Mitchell : You know he's not really your archenemy. that's sort of
a made-up thing.

Alex : Yeah, one's ours. I called. Here it is!
Phil : Hey.
Haley : Uh, so, your table is right here.
Claire : Oh, honey, would you mind getting us a couple drinks? I
would love an iced tea.
Phil : Same, please.
Alex : I'll have a mango-kiwi smoothie, yogurt instead of ice
cream, and make it low-fat. I want to look good when I'm riding in
your new car.
Claire : Honey, I got to say, I like this haircut.
Phil : Hey, we're all just playing for second in this family.
Claire : Hmm.
Waitress : Were you all done here?
Haley : Uh, actually, no. Um, I will have more iced tea, another
iced tea, and a mango-kiwi smoothie, all ice cream. I'm pregnant.
Phil : Well, this is nice. Me, my gals, and my beautiful, beautiful
wife. Just so you know, I rescheduled with Carla. I penciled her in
for the 12th... of never.
Claire : That's too bad. I was kind of looking forward to hearing
about that one.
Phil : Oh. By the way, no one called for you while you were out.

Cameron : Fix it!

Claire : Thank you?

Haley : Hi! You came!

Phil : I just want to make sure you get any messages from any
friends who might call, which none of them did.

Claire : Hi! Of course we did. We wanted to see you work. - Oh.
Phil : We're so proud of you, sweetheart.

Alex : Isn't it weird that Haley's the only one here not wearing a
name tag?
Modern Family Season 2x16 page.6

Phil : If your mother had a name tag, it would say "good driver."
Claire : Phil...

Jay : So, Mitchell called you, too.

Haley : Here you go.

Claire : Mm-hmm. I take it you haven't had your conversation
with Gloria yet?

Alex : I want to hear the specials.Haley : Uh, we're out of specials.
What were they?
Haley : Popular, which you wouldn't understand.

Jay : It's getting worse. She sang all the way here. We passed two
cars... the dogs stuck their heads back inside the window.

Phil : Well, what could be better than drinks with a beautiful
woman? And every beautiful woman deserves flowers.
Cauliflowers.

Claire : Wow.

Claire : Okay. What's going on? Is this about last night?

Cameron : No. Keep that in your back pocket.

Phil : Yeah, I just want you to know how important to me you are.

Phil : Hey.

Claire : Sweetie, I know that. I know that.

Claire : Hey.

Phil : I still feel bad about, you know what I... did.

Phil : I want to show you something.

Claire : Listen to me. You and I are fine. Okay? I'm just really
hungry. Okay?

Claire : Let me guess. It's a copy of "The book thief" that I begged
you to read, but you wouldn't until your dental hygienist said it
changed her life.

Phil : Okay. Okay. All right! What looks good? Oh, gosh. Oh,
here's something that jumps right off the page.

Cameron : What are we gonna do?
Luke : I could start a fire.

Phil : Remember this?

Claire : Uh-huh.

Claire : Uh-huh.

Phil : I tried this yesterday, thanks to my good friend Skip
Woosnum. Claire, do yourself a favor and join me wedge salad.

Phil : It's the first Thanksgiving I spent with your family.

Claire : You have got to be kidding me!

Claire : God, I hated that ponytail.

Phil : Just try it. You will thank me.

Phil : I know. You said it made me look like a wimpy bouncer, so I
cut it off.

Claire : Did you learn nothing from last night?

Claire : Mm.

Phil : Whoa. It was about the salad?

Phil : Just like I lost the feathered earring... and the van with the
beanbag chairs. And I changed my forestry major.

Claire : I have been recommending wedge salads to you, Amongst
other things, for years, and you never listen to me. And then some
idiot suggests it, and you can't wait to try a wedge salad?! It
makes me feel like I don't matter.
Haley : Thanks a lot, dad! Mom's little outburst just got me fired!
Phil : Okay, I got to talk to your mom. You comfort your sister.

Claire : I get it, Phil. I get it. I am the controlling witch that made
you give up everything fun in your l...
Phil : No. No. You're the witch who saved me. Look. Look at this
picture. Now look at this guy. You can't tell me our opinion doesn't
matter. You changed me for the better in a hundred different ways.

Alex : She never worked here!
Modern Family Season 2x16 page.7

Yeah, I... I might miss a book or a salad here and there, but... I've
got Claire all over me.

Jay : Sometimes it takes a lot of work...

Claire : You're about to.

Phil : Harps!

Gloria : That's the worst sound in the world.

Jay : And sometimes it's just excruciating.

Jay : Is it?
Cameron : Friends, uh, family, uh, board members...

Gloria : Jay, come. I work out another song.

Andrew : "Bored" is right.

Jay : Gloria. Gloria.

Cameron : I know we were all looking forward to hearing the
beautiful stylings of Harp Attack, but there has, unfortunately,
been a slight...

Manny : No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I can't take it anymore!
Okay? It's not singing, it's screaming. Mom, I love you, but for the
love of god, destroy that thing before it destroys this family!
Coward!

Mitchell : Don't start yet!
Camerno : delay, and the program will start in a few minutes, on
time. Uh, so, please, everyone take their seats. Thank you. Oh, my
god, you did it! Sort of.
Mitchell : I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but I need to
do a better job of listening to you.

Jay : I think you sound great, but if it bothers the kid...
Manny : Coward!
Manny : You keep this up, and this won't be the last plug I pull.

Cameron : No, no, you did the best you could, and, plus, this is
double what Andrew had last year for "Cello submarine." Thank
you.
Mitchell : Oh.
Cameron : Oh... how are you sitting at a harp and not scoring this
moment? Ladies!
Jay : You can't have a successful marriage without being a good
listener. Sometimes it takes a little work...
Cameron : I just wonder what they're gonna do with their lives,
you know? I just wonder how they can actually, you know, ever
find their true calling with a harp.

Claire : Well, how many people have ordered DVDs and haven't
paid for them?
Phil : Claire...
Claire : Um, yeah. Uh, I guess I could stop by and...
Phil : Really, really important.
Claire : Uh, Cheryl, can I call you back? Okay. Great. Bye. Yes?
What?
Phil : Hey, yeah... I was going through your drawer in the
bathroom looking for some lip stuff because my...
Claire : Lips were dry.
Phil : God, you know me.
Claire : Phil...
Phil : Remember the spa certificates we got at the children's
hospital auction?
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Phil : Well, look at this... they expire tomorrow.
Claire : Oh, wow. What are you gonna do?
Phil : Claire, I don't think you're grasping the magnitude of this
package, valued at over $250.
Claire : Sweetie...
Phil : If you don't use them, then all our money just goes to
charity.
Claire : And so what am I supposed to do? Somewhere between
dropping off Alex at orchestra and picking up Luke from
practice... Oh, and burning a bunch of DVDs of the talent show,
I'm gonna, what, pop in for a quick salt scrub?
Phil : I thought Cheryl was doing the DVDs.

Claire : Well, she's supposed to, but somehow she's got me doing
it.
Phil : Here's what you do. Say, "Cheryl, no can do today. Need a
little 'me time.'"
Claire : Have you met Cheryl? That'll be my new nickname. I'll be
Claire "me time" Dunphy. It's not worth the headache.
Phil : Just say you're sick.
Claire : Then I run into her, and it'll be a whole thing.
Phil : Well, if that happens, you say you're on your way to the
pharmacy to...
Claire : Phil, darling, no, not helping.
Phil : Fine. I'll give them to Florence Gunderman at work. Her
hands look gross ever since she took up the banjo.
Haley : Hey, mom, I need some money for lunch. We're all gonna
go to... Oh, my God! Take off my sweater! Mom, tell her to take it
off!
Claire : Alex, take it off.
Alex : Last week, she wore my sweatshirt without asking.
Claire : That is true.
Haley : Oh, please... that was an honor for your stupid old
sweatshirt. It was the first time the top half got any exercise. Now,
mom, that's my favorite sweater! I just got it.
Claire : You know what you girls need to learn to do? You need to
learn to share, because that's what sisters do. All right, Haley,
nothing's gonna happen to your sweater. Right, Alex?
Alex : Hmm?
Haley : Okay, fine. Then I will just go put on your favorite nerdy tshirt, the one with the guy from "Back to the future" on it.
Alex : That's Albert Einstein! And it is not nerdy!
Claire : Well...

Modern Family Season 2x17 page.1

Mitchell : Hi!

Alex : It's too happy. Oh, my God!

Cameron : Hey, daddy.

Claire : Okay, hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Let's see. It might not
be a big deal. Just... here we go. Let's see. Oh, okay.

Mitchell : How was the farmers' market? Well, it was great, but
guess what the new spinach is.

Alex : Is it bad?

Cameron : Um, radicchio?

Claire : No, it's gonna be fine. You're gonna be okay. Oh, honey.

Mitchell : Kale.

Haley : Hey, I forgot my phone.

Cameron : No!

Claire : Hi.

Mitchell : I know. I was just as blown away as you are.

Haley : What?

Claire : Oh, well, I guess we're going to have to adopt... yay... a
new attitude towards kale. Maybe we'll even adopt a new
vinaigrette. Adopt, yay!

Claire : Nothing. I love you.

Mitchell : Okay, what's going on here?
Cameron : I'm taking the negative charge out of the word
"adopted." Yay.
Mitchell : What did Oprah do now?
Cameron : Well, she had a girl on who, at 16, found out that she
was adopted and felt betrayed, ran away, and became a stripper...
and not the heart-of-gold kind, the by-the-airport kind.
Mitchell : Okay.
Cameron : All right. Go get your gavel, judge Judy.
Mitchell : No, not at all. I'm adopting...

Haley : So weird. You better not spill anything on that, okay, dork?
Alex : Relax. Half the 11th grade's been inside this sweater.
Claire: More than anything I want my girls to stop fighting and be
close. I want them to share clothes and do each other's hair and
gossip about boys... Like I used to do with Mitchell.
Jay : Gloria! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Manny : Hey, Jay, have you noticed a spring in my step?
Jay : Oh, kids say cruel things. That doesn't mean you'll turn out
that way.

Cameron : Ahh!

Manny : No. We have something in common. I'm seeing a
younger woman.

Mitchell : ...a tolerant attitude toward your flights of lunacy.

Jay : How much younger are we talking about?

Cameron : Adopting! Yay!

Manny : 13 months. Her name's Chloe. She makes me feel like a
5th grader again.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Jay : Good for you, kid.
Gloria : Hmm. There they are... my two dirty old men.

Claire : Alex, come on. Hurry up. The later we are, the more
Cheryl texts me to do.

Jay : Hey, pretty soon you're gonna be north of 40 and I'm gonna
have to trade you in for a newer model. Am I right, buddy?

Alex : I'm coming, I'm coming.

Manny : That's my mother, Jay.

Claire : Tell me again why the violin just wasn't you.

Jay : You ready?
Modern Family Season 2x17 page.2

Gloria : It's such a beautiful day. Why do we have to do this?

Mitchell : And we're monkeys because...

Jay : Because when this thing is behind us, it's done and we never
have to think about it again. Come on.

Cameron : I can draw monkeys.

Jay : I went to a funeral last Saturday, and it got me thinking about
where Gloria and I were gonna end up after we die.

Cameron : Oh, my God.

Gloria : Yeah, it's been a fun week.

Cameron : Lily's adoption certificate. Her name is "Lily Tucker
Pritchett."

Jay : I don't like loose ends. So I made a few calls. I found these
people selling a couple of primo plots in the best cemetery in
town. Not that I'm gonna go there anytime soon.

Mitchell :Okay, well, I think this is a great project, and I believe
you are gonna finish it.
Mitchell : What?

Mitchell : Right.

Gloria : Don't be so sure... with all the bacon that he eats.

Cameron : Not "Tucker-Pritchett" like it's supposed to be. First
name... "Lily." Middle name... "Tucker." Last name... "Pritchett."

Jay : Well, got to give my cholesterol pills something to do.

Mitchell : Well, that can't be right.

Mitchell : Mm. I don't care how much they promote it, kale is a
garnish. It's not ready to anchor a meal.
Cameron : Look at this.
Mitchell : Oh, my God! Lily's little hat that we bought her at the
airport in Vietnam. Remember how cute she looked in that?
Cameron : Remember how I used to wear it and walk around and
act like I had a giant head?
Mitchell : Mm-hmm. That was good acting.
Cameron : Oh...
Mitchell : So, what are you doing?
Cameron : I'm putting together a little scrapbook of how Lily
became ours. You know, her adoption certificate, some pictures of
her from her village... All out in the open, so she has nothing to be
ashamed of.
Mitchell : You leaving that on all day?
Cameron : You know, and I'm also gonna write a little storybook...
You know, something I can read her at bedtime. It's called "Two
monkeys and a panda." She's the panda because she's Asian.

Cameron : This is a legal document! She only has your last name.
M... m...my name is just a middle name!
Mitchell : Stay calm. Don't get upset.
Cameron : Nobody knows anyone's middle name! Quick... what's
my middle name?
Mitchell : Scott.
Cameron : Of course you know mine. We're a couple!
Mitchell : Okay, look, t...this is obviously a mistake.
Cameron : But you're the one who filled out this paperwork. You
don't make mistakes like this. You correct mistakes like this. You
did this on purpose.
Mitchell : What?
Cameron : So your name could have top billing.
Mitchell : Okay, no, I am not gonna sit here and listen to you
accuse me of something so horrible!
Cameron : It makes so much sense now... Why you wanted to fill
out all these legal forms.
Mitchell : Okay, well, I'm a lawyer! I fill out all the legal forms,
ever since you signed up for a 12-year gym membership!
Modern Family Season 2x17 page.3

Cameron : The more you spend, the more you save!
Phil : All the women at work were too busy to use this certificate,
so I called the spa and asked them to extend the expiration date.
But they said no. Really? Here's something they didn't count on.
You mess with Phil Dunphy, the claws come out.

Jay : These are not like our drawers at home. People can find
things in these.
Woman : I'm thinking of getting bangs.
Phil : Ooh, you totally should. You would be so cute with bangs.
You have the face for it. I don't. Oh, there's my better half. Kim,
would you mind? Thank you. Hey, honey. Where are you?

Kim : You have very nice hands. Soft like lady's.

Claire : Oh, I'm on my way to Downey.

Phil : Thank you, Kim. I appreciate that. My wife never seems to
notice.

Phil : Oh, uh, did you know Karen and Richard Carpenter grew
up in Downey?

Jay ; This is it! Ta-da!

Claire : What random and not-helpful fact, Phil. I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm having kind of a rough day.

Gloria : What is ta-da?

Phil : Yeah, I'm kind of having a rough day myself.

Jay : I'm just saying this is it. Ta-da.

Claire : Look, Phil, I need you to take care of dinner for me.

Gloria : "Ta-da" is when you do a flip or where the magician cuts
the pretty lady in half, not when you show someone where you
want to shove their dead body.

Phil : What's wrong?

Jay : I'm not gonna argue the proper use of "ta-da." This is it.

Claire : Oh, Alex ripped Haley's favorite sweater, and now I'm
driving around from store to store, trying to find the exact same
one before Haley finds out.

Gloria : Seriously? In the file cabinet?

Phil : Don't do that. Just explain to her what happened.

Jay : It's called a crypt. And how are you not getting how great this
is? We're four down from Bugsy Siegel.

Claire : Mnh-mnh. Haley's not gonna understand.

Gloria : No. I'm not going into any wall. I'm going in the ground.

Claire : No, Phil, you don't understand. I'm trying to avoid this
turning into a whole big thing.

Jay : Sorry, not me. There's enough to not like about death without
adding dirt and worms. The whole thing gives me the willies.
Gloria : You die, you go to the ground. Is natural. You go back to
the earth. Here, you're just a mushy bag of bones rotting away for
all eternity! Sorry for your loss. Can we get the hell out of here?

Phil : Sure, she will.

Phil : Then just get her something close. She'll never know the
difference.
Claire : Phil, could you just take care of dinner, sweetie? That's all
I'm asking. That's it.

Jay : What am I supposed to tell the guy?

Phil : I'm just saying, there's a simpler way to do this.

Gloria : Tell them we don't want our bodies inside these drawers
where God cannot find us!

Claire : There is no simpler way. Just make dinner! Thank you.
Phil : Hello? What?

Modern Family Season 2x17 page.4

Ed : Mr. Pritchett... We're the Rutledges, the ones selling the spots.
Winnie : Hi. Hi. Oh, my gosh. Look, honey. I hadn't heard. Martin
is in.
Ed : Well, look at that.
Jay : I'm sorry. Is that a friend of yours? We've made a point to get
to know everyone in the neighborhood.

Cameron : It occurs to me that I may have gotten a little too upset
and jumped to some conclusions that were perhaps not true. I
realize now that you would never intentionally do something so
unthinkable. So... I just wanted to say I'm sorry for accusing you.
Mitchell : I did it.
Cameron : I knew it! You two-faced...

Winnie : We think it makes it less awkward, you know, later.

Mitchell : Let me explain.

Jay : Oh, I'm sorry. This is my wife, Gloria.

Cameron : There is... there is no explanation. There is just no
excuse. I just want to know why!

Winnie : Oh.
Ed : I'm Ed, and this is my bunk. And this is my loving wife and
devoted mother of three, Winnie. She'll be here.
Jay : I don't know what our lineup is yet. But at home, I sleep on
the right side, so probably there.
Winnie : We don't mean to be rude, but you seem to be much
younger than your husband.
Gloria : You're not rude. I'm very much younger.
Jay : Is that a problem?
Ed : Well, it's just that there's a good chance, uh, you'll be moving
in long before she would.
winnie : Our concern is, your wife remarries, and she wants to be
laid to rest with her new husband. So she sells this spot to the
highest bidder.
Ed : And we're left lying next to a complete stranger, without even
so much as a formal "how do you do?"

Mitchell : Okay, y... you know how, um, s... some women say that
they forget how painful childbirth was? Well, I... I... I think that
you are forgetting how panicked you were before we got Lily. You
were freaking out.
Cameron : I was not!
Mitchell : Okay, so, it says that we can put the mattress at one of
three different levels. Which one should we do?
Cameron : I don't know.
Mitchell : Well, just think about how far down she should be.
Cameron : How far... I don't know! I can't do this!
Mitchell : Okay. Oh, this latch system is great. What did people do
before this?
Cameron : I don't know! Stop asking me questions!

Jay : Gloria, tell them you're in.
Gloria : I don't know, Jay. I think they have a very good point.
And they're not crazy at all.

Mitchell : Cam...
Cameron : I can't do this! I can't!

Jay : What do you mean they have a good point?
Gloria : I don't think this is going to work. Good luck getting
someone into your drawers.

Cameron : Okay, well, I... I don't see what that has to do with
anything.

Modern Family Season 2x17 page.5

Mitchell : I... I was scared that... that it was just gonna all be too
much for you and that you were gonna leave. And then I would be
the one taking care of a baby and half of her last name would
belong to the guy who left us. It was a mistake. I'm sorry. I... I
wanted to have it changed, but I needed to get your signature, and
I was afraid that it would start a big fight and that you would hate
me and...

Woman : Yes! Yes!

Phil : OK, I'm confused... you're saying that if she tells me she has
a problem, I'm not supposed to help her?

Phil : And if she says, "Phil, the TV's driving me crazy," I should
just say, "I know! There is not enough quality programming for
women."

Woman : Not unless she asks for your help.
Phil : But if she lets me help her, I can make her problem go away.
Woman : That is such a male thing to say.
Phil : Well, forgive me for being a man.
Kim : Mango or kiwi?
Phil : Ooh, kiwi.
Woman : When you say, you know, "do this or do that," all she's
hearing is, "I'm smarter than you."
Phil : Believe me, she doesn't think that.
Woman : She doesn't want you to solve her problems. She just
wants you to give her support so that she can solve her problems
herself. Yes, and sometimes... sometimes she just wants a
sympathetic ear.

Phil : And... and if she says, uh, uh... "The waiter I had today was
so rude," I shouldn't say, "maybe you should just order something
on the menu for once."
Woman : No.
Phil : I should just say, "what a jerk."
Woman : Yes! Yes!

Woman : No! Turn off the damn TV.
Phil : Okay, now I'm confused again.
Manny : So, I heard you had a rough time today.
Jay : Yeah, well...
Manny : Remember the days when we thought we'd live forever?
Jay : Don't you want to go play?
Manny : When do I ever play? I'm kind of wrestling with this
whole "older man, younger woman" thing. It's like Chloe and I
grew up in different worlds. Today I made a joke about the
wiggles. It went right over her head.
Jay : I don't know what that is.

Phil : Whoa. Whoa. Maybe it's all the creams, but that just made
sense, girlfriends. So if Claire says, "I hate getting stuck in traffic," I
shouldn't say, "maybe u should leave earlier"...

Manny : It's an expression... means she didn't get it.

Woman : No.

Jay : I always knew your mother might remarry after I'm gone.
That never bothered me. I figured her husbands would be your
dad, me, and some putz who could never live up to me. But what
if I'm not the main guy? What if some other guy is? What if I'm the
putz?

Phil : Or, "don't get on the freeway."
Woman : No.
Phil : I should just say, "I know. It's so frustrating."
Woman : Yes! That's it!

Jay : Yeah, it sometimes.. this age thing... knocks you in the head.
Manny : That what this is about?

Phil : Really?
Modern Family Season 2x17 page.6

Manny : When my mom and dad got divorced, do you have any
idea how many guys chased after her? The phone didn't stop
ringing. Men would stop her on the street. Guys would propose to
her from moving cars. They were good-looking guys, Jay... with
money. I think one of them was a Kennedy.

Claire : Mwah.
Alex : Uh-oh.
Claire : What?
Alex : The security tag... it's still on!

Jay : Where are you going with this?

Claire : I told those people to take that off.

Manny : When you showed up, I didn't think you had a prayer.
You were so nervous and sweaty, I felt sorry for you.

Alex : Oh, no. She's pulling into the driveway!
Claire : Okay. It's fine. It's fine. Don't panic. I've got it. I've got it.

Jay : I had to climb three flights of stairs.

Alex : She's getting out of the car!

Manny : But of all people, my mom fell for you.

Claire : All right! I am doing it! I've almost got it. I... Oh, God! Oh,
no!

Jay : I got a few moves.
Manny : She said she fell in love with you during your first fight.
Jay : What?
Manny : She said she'd finally met her match.
Jay : Oh.
Manny : So if you think she's just gonna replace you when you're
gone, then you are the putz.

Alex : What is that?!
Claire : Well, it's ink.
Alex : Aah! Hide it. Hide it. She's in the house!
Haley : What are you doing with my sweater? Oh, my God! It's
ruined!
Alex : It was an accident!

Jay : Thanks, kid, I appreciate that. I thought you liked me when I
first showed up.

Haley : I knew this would happen, you idiot!

Manny : Please. For the first month, I didn't even bother to learn
your name.

Haley : I wish she was never even born!

Claire : Hey, hey! Let's try to get along.
Alex : They were trying to make one with a brain!
Claire : Not fair! Honey, you guys are both... oh... pretty smart.

Claire : Is she back yet?

Phil : Ohh... Geez. It's that sweater, huh?

Alex : She's on her way. Did you find it?

Claire : Yeah. It is that sweater. And I did everything I can to stop
them from fighting.

Claire : I did. At the fifth store I went to. It was in the window, and
I had to undress a mannequin while a creepy guy filmed it, so we
have to look forward to on the Internet.
Alex : Ugh. Thank you so much, mom.
Claire : You're welcome. Now, go put that exactly where you
found the other one, okay?
Alex : Okay.

Phil : I don't understand why they can't see how much you love
them.
Claire : I don't know. Meanwhile, Cheryl has be calling me all day
because she's angry I didn't show up.
Phil : Doesn't Cheryl have a housekeeper and a nanny? Why does
she need so much help?
Modern Family Season 2x17 page.7

Claire : I know, right?
Phil : You work so hard. You do so much.
Claire : I do.
Phil : Of course you do.
Claire : I do. I do. Oh, sweetie, thank you. I really appreciate that.
Phil : Hey.
Claire : Yeah?
Phil : Who's my gal?
Claire : I am.
Phil : Darn right. Yeah. Mwah! Oh. Let me get this. Hey, by the
way... notice anything different about me?
Claire : Unh-unh. What is it?

Gloria : Look at this. An empty coffee can. Do you know what
men used to buy me?
Jay : When I go, toss me in the fire, sweep up my ashes, stick 'em
in that. Ta-da!
Gloria : We need to talk about this "ta-da."
Jay : 'Cause I don't care if it's in a wall or if it's in the ground... Just
as long as I end up with you.
Gloria : Oh, Jay.
Jay : It's perfect. Jay Pritchett sitting on the mantel in the old coffee
can. That will drive the putz crazy. And I like that.

Claire : A haircut?

Mitchell : Um, so, f... for whatever it's worth, I... I called the
adoption attorney... Adoption, yay! And on Monday, they're gonna
start the process of changing Lily's last name to "Tucker-Pritchett."

Phil : A week ago.

Cameron : Great.

Claire : Okay, so, tell me.

Mitchell : Again, I'm... I'm so sorry.

Phil : Forget it. It's not important.

Cameron : Okay.

Claire : Okay.

Mitchell : Um... oh, I, uh... I took a quick pass at "Two monkeys
and a panda." So, just let me know what you think. Um... "Once
upon a time, there were two monkeys. They loved each other very
much, but there was something missing."

Phil : Nothing.

Phil : I'll just go start dinner.
Jay : Listen, I've been thinking. When I go, I want you to know...
it's okay if you marry someone else.

Cameron : A hyphen?

Jay : You're driving me crazy on purpose, right?

Mitchell : "They wanted a baby. And they heard that there was a
very special baby in a faraway land who needed a family. She was
a panda named Lily. One of the monkeys was scared. They'd never
had a panda before. But they held Lily in their arms, and the
scared monkey became the brave one. And the two monkeys..."

Gloria : Jay, I'm not going to marry anyone else.

Cameron : Coco and Miko.

Jay : That's what you say now, but no one knows what the future
holds. So I want you to have this.

Mitchell : I'm sorry. What?

Gloria : I know.
Jay : Because I want you be happy.
Gloria : I'll be happy.

Cameron : "Coco" and "Miko" are the names of the monkeys.

Modern Family Season 2x17 page.8

Mitchell : Really? That doesn't seem like it's a little un... Coco and
Miko. I like that. I like that. Coco and Miko... yeah. "They traveled
all the way home with the perfect panda that they adopted."
Cameron : Did she just clap? She heard "adopted" and clapped!
Mitchell : Cam! That's amazing! Oh, my God! You did that!
Cameron : Well, I don't...
Mitchell : What?! You did that. That is amazing. I can't believe
that.
Mitchell : And just like that, peace returned to our house. Well,
technically, it...it's my house, but... I... I will... I will fix that, too.
Mitchell : Once we finished writing the book, we realized
something.
Cameron : We're not the only two monkeys with a panda. Gay
parents are a huge market, and no one's writing for them. We
thought we were sitting on a gold mine.
Mitchell : But we weren't.
Mitchell : Oh. "Gay parenting."
Cameron : Oh.
Mitchell : "Gay adoptive parenting."
Cameron : Okay.
Mitchell : "Gay adoption: Foreign children."
Cameron : Wow.
Mitchell : "Gay adoption: Asian children."
Cameron : What?
Mitchell : "Bisexual adoption: Asian children." "Transgendered
adoption."
Cameron : Okay, come on. Let's go, Miko.

Modern Family
2x18 : Boys' Night

Alex : You drool all the time. Mom had to take you to a specialist.
Luke : I'm still growing into my tongue.
Haley : Hey, mom, can I go to the movies with Robin?

Manny : Morning, mom.

Claire : No, you may not, 'cause you are still grounded.

Gloria : Good morning, papi.

Haley : Then can I be sent to my room?

Manny : Am I right, Jay?

Claire : No, 'cause we're having some fun family time. We're
gonna spend this beautiful afternoon outside in the fresh air,
getting some exercise, okay? Pitch it, Phil.

Jay : Your days ends at 2:30.
Manny : Can't come fast enough. Quitting time. Am I right, Jay?
Jay : Let's not make this a thing.
Manny : Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this? Where's my soft-boiled
egg?

Phil : Oh, well.
Claire : That's the game.
Luke : What do you mean? We just started.

Gloria : I scrambled it. It's good for you to try new things.

Phil : That was our only ball.

Manny : I don't want to try new things. You can't just spring this
on me.

Luke : So what? The game's over just because you're afraid of
stupid Mr. Kleezak?

Gloria : I have bad news, Manny. This is not the biggest curve ball
that life is going to throw you.

Phil : Yep. I'm not going over there. That was fun.

Jay : Buddy, don't close yourself off from new things. I ever tell
you the story about me and crab cakes? Thought I didn't like
them, tried them, love them.

Claire : If Hannibal Lecter and Freddy Krueger had a love child,
he would be afraid of our next-door neighbor.

Manny : Wow. Are the movie rights available for that one?

Phil : I don't have a mean thing to say about anyone, but Mr.
Kleezak is... not a nice person.
Claire : Easy, honey.

[OPENING CREDITS]
Mitchell : Hey, Haley.
Phil : Dunphy spring classic. Who's gonna do the dishes for the
next week? Boys versus girls. Testosterone versus estrogen.
Standing up to pee versus the squat.
Claire : Phil, come on!
Phil : Swing and a miss.
Claire : Ohh.
Phil : He's in her head, Luke.
Luke : And boys rule and girls drool.

Haley : Oh, hey, Uncle Mitchell.
Mitchell : Hey, is your mom home?
Haley : No. She had to take Alex to the oncologist.
Mitchell : Oh, my God, what's wrong?
Haley : She needed new glasses.
Mitchell : Oh. Did you mean optometrist?
Haley : Whatever. So, should I give her a message?
Modern Family Season 2x18 page.1

Mitchell : Yes, yes. Could you ask her if she could possibly babysit
Lily on Saturday night? We'd really, really appreciate it.
Mitchell ! : Saturday night, we're having dinner with Pepper,
Longinus, and Crispin.

Haley : Luke? Luke?
Cameron : What are you thinking?! Haley is a very sweet and
fashionable girl, but seems hardly a responsible caregiver!

Cameron : They're our gay friends.

Mitchell : Well, you know what? We needed a sitter. She's family. I
say we give her a shot.

Mitchell : I think that was clear. I've been spending a lot of time
with a lot of straight people lately. And, darling, I need a night
with my homies.

Cameron : A shot? Oh, with our only child? Sure, why not? If
something goes wrong, we'll just pop over to the orient and grab
another one.

Cameron : You mean homos.
Mitchell : Okay. Yeah. You know what? Maybe you should stay in
and babysit.

Mr. Kleezak : What?
Luke : My name is Luke Dunphy. I live next door.
Mr. Kleezak :What do you want?

Mitchell : Yeah, our babysitter bailed, and we're kind of in a bind,
so...
Haley : I can do it. I can watch Lily. I'm really good. I'm
babysitting Luke right now.
Mitchell : Oh, yeah? You want... you want to babysit Lily? Oh,
well, that's very sweet, honey, but you're... you're a very popular
girl. I'm sure you have better things to do, so...

Luke : I want to get our ball from your yard.
Mr. Kleezak :I don't want you messing around back there. Just go
home.
Luke : Are you going scuba diving?
Mr. Kleezak :Hmm?
Luke : Why do you have that tank?

Haley : Oh, seriously, I'm totally free.

Mr. Kleezak :You being smart?

Haley : Being grounded is so much worse than it was in the olden
days. My friends text and Facebook all the fun stuff they're doing
while I'm stuck at home playing jenga with my dad.

Mr. Kleezak :For fun.

Phil : Are you serious?

Luke : You mean in school? Well, I do okay. My teacher says I get
distracted. Why do you have that tube in your nose?
Luke : Really? Can I try?
Mr. Kleezak :It's oxygen.
Luke : We have that in our house, but we don't need tanks.

Haley : You don't even have to pay me. I promise I'll take super
good care of her.
Mitchell : Okay, well, that would be great. Thank you. Yes, well,
we'll see you on Saturday night. Bye, sweetie.
Mitchell : Bye.

Mr. Kleezak :Oh, for God's sake, just get your ball.
Luke : Okay.
Alex : Oh my God! I was watching the news, and another flock of
birds fell out of the sky dead. What is happening?
Modern Family Season 2x18 page.2

Claire : Sweetie, you got to stop watching the news.

Luke : He likes to melt stuff. Like you're so perfect.

Alex : That's your big solution... embrace ignorance?

Phil : Luke, I'm sorry, but your mother and I just aren't
comfortable with this.

Luke : What are you two arguing about? Never mind, I don't want
to know. Be back in a couple hours.
Claire : Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you going?

Luke : That's so unfair. You don't even know him 'cause you're too
afraid to talk to him.

Luke : To my friend Walt's house to watch "High noon."

Phil : Buddy, we're just looking out for you.

Phil : Ooh, I love westerns... the bloodier, the better. That's my
favorite type of movie... That and anything set against the
backdrop of competitive cheerleading.

Luke : You never like any of my friends.

Claire : Is Walt the one who's always skateboarding?No.

Claire : I don't know. I mean, he makes a point. We don't know the
man, and little kids can be friends with old people, right?

Luke : Where would he put his oxygen tank?
Claire : Okay, now I'm really confused.
Luke : You sound like Walt. He gets confused a lot. It's hilarious.
Phil : Wait, are we talking about Mr. Kleezak?
Luke : Yeah. I went over to his house to get my ball, and we've
been hanging out.

Claire : We're doing the right thing.
Phil : Absolutely. Aren't we?

Phil : Of course they can. There's tons of examples. "Up," um,
"Gran Torino," "True grit."
Claire : Cartoon, kills himself, she loses an arm. We've got to go
talk to that guy.
Phil : Now?

Claire : You were in Mr. Kleezak's house? Luke, that is not okay.

Claire : Yeah.

Luke : Why not? He's really nice and funny. Listen to this joke.
Okay, two krauts walk into a bar.

Phil : It's so dark.

Claire : Phil, this is not good.

Cameron : Okay, so, the numbers are by the phone. There's food in
the fridge. I just changed her diaper, so all you need to do is put
her down in about a half-hour and not let a serial killer in the front
door.

Phil : Honey, don't jump to conclusions. Let him finish the joke.
Luke : And one of them has a limp.
Phil : Uh-huh.
Claire : You may not go back to that man's house.
Luke : Why not?
Claire : Because... he's weird.
Phil : And not very nice.
Claire : Yeah.
Luke : That's what you said about my friend Oliver.

Haley : Well, what if he's cute?
Mitchell : Then save him for us.
Cameron : Nobody in, nobody out.
Haley : Oh, we're gonna be totally fine. You just go get your gay
on.
Mitchell : Oh, it is on like Donkey Kong. Well, clearly it's not on
yet, but it will be. So, okay, come on. Let's go.

Claire : Oliver. Oliver who almost burned down our garage?
Modern Family Season 2x18 page.3

Jay : I'm telling you, kid, this is a concert you're never gonna
forget. Mm-hmm. Greatest music in the world. Wait a minute.
What's this?
Gloria : What do you mean?
Jay : What are we seeing?
Gloria : The symphony "The four seasons."
Jay : I thought we were seeing Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.
Manny : No.
Gloria : No, it's Vivaldi.
Jay : Oh, crap. You mean nothing but instruments? I'm out of here.

Longinus : I'm telling you, John Schneider was the one!
Mitchell : John Schneider, from "The Dukes of Hazzard"?
Cameron : That was your first crush?
Longinus : Oh, my God, yes. Bo Duke... delicious.
Pepper : He was a redneck who drove a car called the General Lee
with a giant confederate flag on it. That wasn't a turn-off for you?
Longinus : Look, I know it was all kinds of wrong, but the heart
wants what the heart wants.

Gloria : No, you're not out. You're in.

Cameorn : Richard Gere. Oh, my God. I'll be the officer. Don't be a
gentleman.

Jay : I hate this kind of music.

Pepper : Montgomery Clift.

Gloria : Jay, you always do that. Every time we try something
new, your first reaction is always no.

Crispin : Who?

Jay : It's 'cause I'm old enough to know what I like and what I
don't like.
Manny : What about the crab cakes?

Pepper : Don't do that, Crispin. You're not that young. Anyway,
my crush was gay. At least I had a shot.
Cameron : You had a shot with Montgomery Clift? How old are
you?

Jay : That was a fluke. And I can't slather that boring music in
tartar sauce.

Pepper : I will cut you like it was nothing, farm boy.

Manny : So I have to try new things, like scrambled eggs, but you
don't have to?

Longinus : Wait. What about you, Mitchell?

Gloria : You see what you're doing? You're tearing this family
apart.
Jay : Let's take it down a notch. You two go in. Have a great time.
I'll see you later.
Gloria : What are you going to do?
Jay : I'm gonna walk like a man, fast as I can, to that bar over
there. And if you knew Frankie Valli, you'd be cracking up right
now.
Gloria : It's okay.

Mitchell : Oh, see, I miss this.
Mitchell : Um, okay, well, I... I didn't know it was a crush because
I was only 8 at the time.
Pepper : I knew when I was 8.
Crispin : Everyone knew when you were 8.
Pepper : Longinus, get up. We're switching seats.
Mitchell : Okay, okay, back to me, back to me, back to me. So, I
had just seen "St. Elmo's fire," and...
Cameron : Oh, Mitchell, look, it's your father.
Crispin : Ooh. That's your father?
Pepper : He's cute.
Mitchell : Okay, can you please turn it off for one second?
Modern Family Season 2x18 page.4

Longinus : Ooh, he's all alone. Invite him over.

Mitchell : No, no, I wasn't.

Mitchell : Yeah, that's not something we're gonna do.
Crispin : Relax, your dad knows you're gay.

Pepper : Let me bring you up to speed. Crispin's was Joey
McIntyre... whoever that is. Longinus said John Schneider.

Mitchell : He doesn't know I'm this gay.

Jay : Your name is Longinus?

Pepper : Excuse us? Oh, Mr. Pritchett!

Longinus : I know. I never stood a chance.

Cameron : Jay! Jay!

Pepper : Cam's was Richard Gere, and I was Monty Clift.

Pepper : Yoo-hoo!

Jay : Well, at least yours was gay. I mean, you might've had a shot.

Longinus : Oh, he looks like that dentist you hooked up with in
Laguna.

Pepper : Thank you. Crispin, up. I'm sitting next to this one.
Welcome.

Crispin : Oh, yeah, yeah. That was in my daddy phase.
Mitchell : Yes, please, keep this up. This is fun for me.

Phil : He's right there.

Jay : Fellas, how you doing?

Claire : All right.

Mitchell : Hey, dad.

Phil : Mr. Kleezak?

Cameron : Hi, Jay.

Claire : Mr. Kleezak? It's open. Honey, he's not moving. Is he
okay?

Crispin : Hello, daddy.
Mitchell : What are you doing here?
Jay : I'm just getting a drink while Gloria and Manny see a show.
Pepper : Well, please join us.
Jay : No, I don't want to intrude.
Mitchell : He doesn't want to intrude.
Longinus : You are not intruding.
Jay : I'm just gonna watch the game at the bar.
Mitchell : He just wants to watch the game at the bar, so...
Cameron ; Oh, sit down. We're up by 25 with a minute to go.
Jay : Well, maybe just for a minute. Okay. So, what does a guy got
to do to get a drink around here?
Mitchell : Nobody say anything.
Pepper : Justin, more booze.
Crispin : Oh, Mitchell was just about to tell us who his first boy
crush was.

Phil : Well, there's only one way to find out.
Claire : Mr. Kleezak? Mr. Kleezak? Okay, look. I... I don't know if
he's breathing. Does he have a pulse?
Phil : Well, there's only one way to find out.
Claire : Would you stop pushing me? You do it.
Phil : I hate this. I'm gonna kill Luke. Oh, my God. He's ice-cold.
Walt : Hey!
Claire : Oh, my God!
Phil : Ugh!
Claire : I'm sorry. We thought there was something wrong with
you.
Phil : Sorry.
Walt : What?!
Claire : We thought there was something wrong with you! Phil.
Phil : Hi. We haven't, uh, formally met. Phil Dunphy.
Modern Family Season 2x18 page.5

Walt : Yeah, I know you. You're the guy who just broke into my
house and fondled me.
Phil : No. No. We were just concerned that you looked dead. No
offense.

Pepper : Gina Lollobrigida!
Jay : Bingo! And for the rest of my life, I swore, one day, I would
marry Gina Lollobrigida.
Mitchell : Well, dad, you kind of did.

Walt : Well, what... what... what... what are you doing here?

Pepper : I hear that!

Claire : Oh, um, our son, Luke, told us that you invited him over
here to watch movies, and I'm sure you could understand why we
would... be concerned about that.

Jay : Mmm. These are good. What's in them?

Walt : No.
Claire : Phil.
Phil : You're doing great.
Claire : Honey.
Walt : Wait, are you saying that I'm some kind of pervert?
Claire : No. Probably...Not.
Walt : Look, I didn't ask him to come over here. I was minding my
own business, like you should be.
Claire : Okay. But in all fairness, our son is our business.
Walt : Well, then, keep him. And keep your daughter from driving
into my garbage cans.
Claire : I...
Walt : And keep your blinds closed when you're doing your little
sexy dance.
Phil : Oh, God, he's seen my sexy dance.
Jay : So... I'm 12 years old, and I'm staying over night at my best
friend Jim's house, and neither one of us want to go to sleep.
Crispin : I know where this is going.
Jay : You're better than that, Crispin.

Longinus : It's a margarita with a shot of absinthe.
Pepper : Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.
Crispin : Ohh, are you making a bad pun or just lisping?
Pepper : I can't believe I drove all the way to the Valley to pick you
up.
Jay : Justin, more booze!
Mitchell : Oh!
Cameron : Haley, hi. Is... is everything okay?
Haley : Yeah, why?
Cameron : Because I just saw a man walk through the living room.
Haley : What? Where are you?
Cameron : I can see through the camera on the computer.
Haley : You're spying on me? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That is so
lame. Look, I don't know what you think you saw... Maybe the TV,
or the reflection, or maybe you think that my body's just shaped
like a boy, like I don't have hips or something.
Cameron : No, no, no, no. You have a... a darling figure. I was just
concerned that...
Haley : That hurts so much. This is the kind of thing that I expect
from my mother, but not from my cool uncle, so thank you for all
of your trust.

Jay : So, we sneak off to the movies, and we see this little picture
called "Solomon and Sheba." And Sheba was...

Cameron : Okay, I'm... sorry. Sorry.

Cameron : Gina Lollobrigida!

Dylan : Okay.

Haley : Unbelievable. You got to go.

Modern Family Season 2x18 page.6

Pepper : Thank you. Thank you.
Mitchell : Dad, I've never seen you sing before.
Jay : Well, you never saw me in the shower. And don't anybody go
there.

Dylan : I go a lot of places without shoes. I'm not wearing shoes
right now. Oh, wait. That's 'cause I left them at your uncles's
house.
Haley : This is a disaster!
Dylan : Well, maybe they'll think they're theirs.
Haley : They're gay. They know what shoes they own.

Mitchell : When I was 12 years old, my father walked into my
bedroom and caught me doing the most embarrassing thing that a
boy can do... dancing to Madonna's "Lucky star." And from that
moment on, there's always been a part of me that I've kept from
him. And yet, yeah, here he was, you know, laughing with my
friends. And... I don't know. Maybe the problem was me.

Luke : Thanks a lot, Walt. You couldn't be nice to my parents for
two seconds, so now I'm not allowed to hang out with you.
Walt : What do you want from me?
Luke : I thought you were my friend. You promised to teach me
how to grow tomatoes, and you were gonna take me for an egg
cream.

Mitchell : Rob Lowe.

Walt : Forget it. You're a little kid. I don't need the aggravation.

All : Where? Where? Where? Where?

Luke : Oh, sorry I "aggravated" you. And, just so you know, a lot
of people think I'm adorable.

Mitchell : No, no, Rob Lowe from "St. Elmo's fire." That was... that
was my crush. I loved him.
Jay : I get that. He was a good-looking kid.

Jay : I can't open this.

Mitchell : Right?

Manny : Maybe if you had gone to the concert instead...

Jay : Yeah. Hey, "Walk like a man"?

Jay : Could you open it, please?

Pepper : Well, I can sing it, but I can't do it. I think I just pulled
something!

Manny : I would, but I'm old enough to know that I don't like
opening aspirin bottles.

Jay : Nurse!

Jay : Hello?
Mitchell : Hey, dad!

Haley : Hello?

Jay : How do you guys do it?

Dylan : Please tell me that you have my shoes.
Haley : Why would I have your shoes?

Mitchell : I thought cops could drink. Listen, I just... I wanted to
say I had such a good time with you last night, and I wanted to...

Dylan : Because I left them at your uncles's house last night.

Jay : Hey, hold on. I got call waiting. Yeah.

Haley : What? How could you leave without your shoes?

Pepper : Woof, not a morning person. Good to know. Listen, I'm
five away. I hope you like blueberry scones and dusty Springfield.
Jay : Who is this?
Modern Family Season 2x18 page.7

Pepper : Pepper, silly. It's gonna be a scorcher in the desert today,
so dress accordingly. Oh, this is your street. See you in a minute.

Jay : Yes, thank you. Okay, it's showtime. And with this guy, I
mean that literally.

Jay : Holy crap! That friend of yours, that Pepper. He's on his way
over here. Why?

Pepper : I'm here! Oh, my God. What I could do with this house.
Hello, Jay. Mwah. Mwah. Chop, chop... it's a two-hour drive, not
counting our stop at the outlet mall.

Mitchell : Well, you made a date with him last night. Don't you
remember?
Jay ; I think I would remember if I made a date with a guy!

Jay : Oh, okay. Um, Gloria, we're leaving!
Gloria : Hello. You must be Pepper. Ay, ay, ay. My head.
Jay : What's the matter, Gloria?

Pepper : ‑I'm telling you, I know a guy in Palm Springs who has
every single vintage record known to man. I'm driving out there
tomorrow. Come with me.

Gloria : Oh, nothing. I just had a little ice cream. He hasn't
stopped talking about you all day long.

Jay : It's a date!

Pepper : Wow. You are stunning. How rich are you?

Pepper : All right!

Jay : Are you sure you're all right, Gloria?

Jay : I was drunk. I'm not going shopping with Priscilla, Queen of
the desert.

Gloria : I feel great, mi amor. I am so happy that he's doing this
with you, because I never get him to do anything different, like the
Vivaldi, hmm? I think he likes you more than me. You two have a
great time together.

Mitchell : Okay, dad. Well, I'm feeling really good about our
relationship, and I want to hold on to that for a little while longer,
so I'm gonna go ahead and hang up with you. Give Pepper a big
kiss for me.
Jay : Gloria, now, listen. I know that you're upset with me about
that concert thing, and rightfully so, but you have to help me.
Gloria : What is it?
Jay : It seems I made plans with Mitchell's friend Pepper.

Jay : Why...

Jay : All right, but we got to be back early, because, you know, I
got that work thing.
Gloria : No, no, I canceled everything. You don't have anything.
You can spend all day long with him.
Pepper : Wonderful. Well, shall we?
Pepper : Oh, my God. Tallulah! Oh! Don't worry. She'll stop
yapping when she gets on your lap.

Gloria : That's someone's name? Pepper?
Jay : Yes, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's another guy
named Longinus. But Pepper's gonna be here any second. He's
gonna take me to Palm Springs to go shopping for records. Now,
when he gets here, can you pretend there's some kind of an
emergency? Can you do that, please?
Gloria : Ay, Jay! I... I think you'll have to take me now to the
hospital. My head is in pain. Do you mean like that?

Claire : Alex, honey, come on. We're gonna be late.
Alex : A herd of cows dropped dead for no reason. I'm not going
anywhere. Get your affairs in order, people. This is the end.
Phil : Don't be ridiculous. There's nothing out there to be afraid of.
Hey!
Claire : Oh.
Modern Family Season 2x18 page.8

Phil : Oh!
Claire : Mr. Kleezak.
Walt : I'm not used to waking up with people poking me. I was
startled, you know.

Haley : We need to talk. I know I freaked out on you last night, but
you have to see it from my point of view. You were totally spying
on me.
Cameron : I know.

Claire : We're really sorry about that.

Haley : You were invading my first-amendment right to privacy.

Walt : Yeah, well... these are onions from my garden.

Cameron : We were.

Phil : Wow. Thank you so much.

Haley : I'm sick and tired of people not trusting me.

Claire : That is so nice.

Cameron : I get it.

Walt : Yeah, well, don't go throwing any parades. They're onions.

Haley : And especially you guys. I don't think of you guys as my
uncles, I think of you as my friends. And if your friends don't
believe in you, then what else do you have?

Claire : Uh-huh. Okay?
Walt : I used to be a fireman, you know. I don't hurt kids.
Claire : Sir, would you like to come in?
Walt : Just tell the boy that "Shane" is on today at 3:00. He should
watch it.

Cameron : Dylan's shoes?
Haley : Please don't tell my mom.
Cameron : Buckle up.

Claire : Maybe you could tell him yourself. He's... he's right
upstairs. Hang on. Luke, honey, come on down! Your friend... Walt
is here.
Phil : This is just so sweet.
Claire : Yeah.
Walt : Well, just don't start dancing.
Mitchell : People can surprise you. You get used to thinking of
them one way, stuck in their roles. They are what they are. And
then they do something that shows you there's all this depth and
dimension that you never knew existed.
Cameron : Are you talking about Rob Lowe?
Mitchell : I'm just saying he's a very versatile actor. I think his
good looks have actually held him back.
Cameron : Well, I can relate to that.
Cameron : Haley!

Modern Family

Haley : Why? Are they bad?

2x19 : The Musical Man

Claire : No, they're not bad.
Alex : Are they good?

Phil : Excuse me, I'm so sorry. I never do this with celebrities, but
are you by any chance the foxy mom on the New Horizon realty
ad?

Claire : No, they're average. Sweetie, we did it. Our baby's
average.

Claire : Am I gonna regret doing that?

Claire : Oh.

Phil : Did the mobile man have any regrets? This ad is perfect. See,
I'm not just selling houses, I'm selling myself, and the best part
about me is my family. And my teeth. And both... are on display in
this ad.

Alex : This is just a fluke. She can take them again.

Claire : Mmm.
Luke : "I can't be satisfied until you're satisfied"?
Phil : Coming soon to a bus bench near you, not to mention our
minivan.
Claire : So that's really happening?
Haley : Wait. What's happening to our minivan?
Phil : Having this bad boy shrink-wrapped on it.
Luke : Classy.
Phil : Yep. Now all that driving around your mom does will serve
a purpose.
Alex : Good morning, family. How are you all doing on this
beautiful day?
Claire : Okay. What's this?
Alex : Haley's S.A.T. scores are available online.
Haley : I hate you.
Claire : Oh! Today's the big day. Let's take a look, see how she did.

Phil : Medium five!

Claire : Yeah, and she'll probably do even better. You are gonna
have your choice of some pretty good colleges when the time
comes.
Haley : If I go to college.
Claire : What?
Haley : I've been thinking about it lately, and I might... not. Later!
Alex : Well, we took the scenic route, but we ended up in the same
place.
[OPENING CREDITS]
Cameron : From Zimbabwe to Algeria come on, let me hear ya
these are the countries, these are the countries
Mitchell : Cam recently became Franklin Middle School's interim
musical director.
Cameron : Go, Franklin! I was volunteering for their spring
musical festival when their regular director suddenly and
mysteriously became ill.

Haley : Do we really have to look at them now?
Phil : Don't worry. We're not expecting any miracles.

Cameron : Oh, sorry.

Haley : Thank you.
Claire : Are those Haley's scores? Are you sure?
Modern Family Season 2x19 page.1

Cameron : It may have been a blessing. Their show lacked focus. I
gave it a theme... "A musical trip around the world."

Manny : Do you have to be on all the time?

Mitchell : Yeah, see, he focused it by making it about the world.

Manny : She's in the show with me tonight. I'm thinking of taking
a run at her.

Cameron : You don't like it.

Gloria : You don't "take a run" at a woman. You woo her. You
make her feel special.

Mitchell : No... Cam. I do. Do you... do you think that the kids,
though, are gonna be able to learn it by tonight? I mean, maybe
you should stick with something that they already know.
Cameron : I knew this would happen. Why do you have to throw
a wet blanket on my dreams?
Mitchell : I do not.
Cameron : You do it all the time. And you know what I end up
with? Wet dreams. I heard it as soon as I said it. Just leave it alone.
Mitchell : All right, well, Cam, it's just that sometimes you can be
a little, you know, overenthusiastic.
Cameron : Is it really that big of a deal that I want this to be the
best show in the world?
Mitchell : Well, as long as you heard me.
Cameron : Be in my corner. Don't be so critical.
Mitchell : We... is that really how you see me?
Cameron : Sometimes, yeah, I do, Mitchell.
Mitchell : Oh. Cam, well, if... if that's true, then I'm... I'm sorry.
No, you know, okay, from now on, I am in your corner 100%. Yeah,
that song is gonna knock everyone out.
Cameron : Well, I don't know, but wait till you see the dance I
have prepared.

Gloria : Okay, I'm sorry. Who is this Emma?

Jay : Hey, hon, take a look at this. It's a picture of my butt.
Gloria : And then when you get her, you can tell her whatever you
want. Why do you do this?
Jay : I programmed it so my butt pops up when my brother
Donnie calls. It's a clever way of saying my brother's an ass.
Gloria : Is it?
Jay : That's him. Compose yourselves. Forget I showed you this
picture.
Manny : I'm trying.
Jay : How you doing, you dumb son of a bitch?
Donnie : You old mick. Looks like you've put on a few pounds.
Jay : Oh, you too. What, are you eating your hair?
Donnie : Oh, Gloria. Oh. What are you still doing here? There's
got to be an easier way to get a green card.
Manny : Hey, Uncle Donnie, are you coming to my school concert
tonight?
Donnie : Well...
Jay : It's an hour, tops.
Donnie : ...wouldn't miss it.

Mitchell : A dance? A dance!

Jay : Hey, you know, I think I misplaced my phone. Could you call
me on yours?

Gloria : More toast, Manny?

Donnie : My phone's at the bottom of my bag. Why don't you use
your home phone?

Manny : Why won't you call me, Emma?

Jay : Oh, come on. It's simple.

Gloria : More toast, Emma?

Donnie : What are you doing?
Modern Family Season 2x19 page.2

Jay : I want the phone.

Claire : Yeah, a little while ago.

Donnie : How about you let go, you...

Phil : How's it look?

Jay : Give me the phone, Donnie!

Claire : Uh, well, believe it or not, I have resisted the temptation to
look. This whole Haley thing has got me a little preoccupied.
We're on our way out to lunch right now.

Donnie : You still think you can take me?!
Jay : What? Is this all you got, huh?
Donnie : I'm gonna wash your mouth out with fist.
Gloria : I don't understand this relationship, Emma.
Manny : Hey, Emma. Doing this show, it feels like we've become
like a little family, huh?
Emma : You mean like you're my brother?
Manny : No. N... no, I don't!
Luke : Oh, no! They're back... dinosaur arms!
Manny : This isn't a good time, Luke.
Emma : That is hilarious.
Luke : Half boy, half T-Rex. One foot in both worlds, wanted by
neither.
Manny : Luke, that's a great way to stretch out a shirt.
Cameron : Okay, okay! Break's over, everyone! Let's take it from
the top. Listen, we're running 20 minutes long, so we're gonna go
ahead and cut the Bollywood number.
Delroy : Can I go? I'm late for soccer practice.
Cameron : You know who else missed soccer practice, Delroy? The
cast of "Rent." And now they have a Tony.

Phil : About that, I've been thinking, college is still a ways away. I
say we leave Haley alone. The more we push, the more she'll push
back.
Claire : I'm gonna push.
Phil : And I support that.
Haley : Only dad can make our minivan even lamer.
Claire : Excuse me. What are you doing?
Haley : I'm driving this thing to the reservoir. Just jump when I
say jump.
Claire : Honey, slide over.
Haley : How is this stupid ad supposed to sell houses anyway?
Claire : You heard your father. He's not just selling houses... he's
selling us.
Haley : What are my friends gonna think?
Claire : They are gonna think that you're helping your father put
food on the table.
Gloria : Ay, is the chair broken?

Emma : You are so funny.

Jay : Almost. That cheap, freeloading brother of mine can't keep
his hands off my good scotch, so, you see, I placed that scotch
there. My brother sits in this chair, goes out from under him...
Bam! Masterpiece.

Manny : Seriously?

Gloria : So you make your brother fall and spill his drink?

Luke : We have a Tony.

Jay : Well, I don't want to jinx it, but that's the plan.
Claire : Hello?
Phil : Hey, honey. Did they drop the van off yet?

Gloria : Why are you both so mean? Where I come from, brothers
respect each other. That's why Colombia is such a peaceful utopia.
Modern Family Season 2x19 page.3

Donnie : Hello, ladies.
Jay : Hey, nice shirt. Do they sell men's clothes where you got that?
Gloria : That's funny because women are so inferior.
Donnie : You got no taste. I bought this for Melanie's baptism.
Jay : Who's Melanie?

Claire : No, because to have an apartment, you would need a job.
You want to know what your job is in college? It's a little bit of
class and homework and it's a whole lot of new friends and
experiences and the boys think you're cute and you are cute, and,
oh, trust me, that doesn't last forever. Call the number!

Donnie : Michael's kid, my granddaughter. Oh, I forgot to tell
Irene I landed safely. Hello?

Donnie : All right! You in the mood to lose?

Gloria : How could you not know that your own brother had a
granddaughter?

Donnie : Don't worry, moneybags. I'm not here for a loan.

Jay : I probably knew.
Gloria : How can you forget when he's family? I have 29 cousins,
and I know them all... Rosa Marina, Gloria Maria, Veronica Maria,
Jose Vicente...
Jay : Okay, okay, okay. What's your point?
Gloria : You do the chair, you do the fighting, but you don't know
each other. It's sad.
Jay : Look, I may not talk to my brother the way you talk to your
sisters, but believe me, we're close in our own way.

Jay : First time for everything. You break. So, how's work?
Jay : Nice break.
Donnie : All right, you're solids, which you won't be able to eat in
a few years.
Jay : Right, right. Seriously, though, how are things going with
you?
Donnie : Swell. I'm beating a fat guy at pool right now.
Jay : Donnie, I'm trying to talk to you.
Donnie : Why?

Gloria : When was the last time that you saw him?

Jay : Why? 'Cause that's what people do. Talk about things, like
their lives.

Jay : Well, that's not easy, 'cause he lives up... Huh. See, I want to
say Buffalo.

Donnie : Oh, Irene opened her big trap. Look, I'm fine. It's not like
I'm gonna die.
Jay : What?

Claire : All I'm saying is that there's no downside to more
education.

Donnie : Yeah, they caught it early. I took the treatment. I'm clear
for now. Come on. It's your shot.

Haley : I knew this car ride was a trap.

Jay : Caught what early? Donnie, are you talking about... cancer?

Claire : See that? That right there shows me just how smart you
are. Really? Again? What is going on?

Donnie : You don't have to whisper. I know I got it. You just get
your prostate checked... by a doctor, not some guy you met on the
Internet.

Haley : It's the stupid ad. They're honking on my side, too.
Claire : Oh. Yes, we're the people in the ad. Yeah. Hi. Hey. Another
great thing about college... complete independence.
Haley : I'd have that in an apartment.

Jay : I can't believe you didn't tell me this.
Donnie : Because it's not a big deal. Now, listen. It's just between
us. Oh, God. Irene, how the hell do I know where your glasses
are?
Modern Family Season 2x19 page.4

Claire : And there's frisbee golf, and... and you go snow-sledding
on cafeteria trays. Oh, and you all get a dog together. I don't really
know who takes care of the dog during the summer, but he's there
when you get back.
Haley : Geez, maybe you should just go back to college.
Claire : Oh, honey, do you know what I would give to go back? It's
this moment when your whole life is in front of you, and it's a
magical time. You don't want to miss that, because when it's gone,
it's gone.
Haley : Yeah, yeah.

Phil : Oh, thank God. I'll see you at the show. Love you. Bye. We
got to go.
Cameron : And as the music swells, we reveal our letters spelling
"we love the world." Powerful stuff. And then the majestic
Franklin Middle School insignia will drop into position if Reuben
ever finishes painting it. It's not the Sistine Chapel, Reuben.
Mitchell : Surprise! Hey! Your supportive boyfriend dropped by
to bring you a snack. P.B. and J.
Cameron : Pear, brie, and jambon. My favorite! Okay, people, let's
take five. A true five.
Mitchell : Hey, Manny. How's it going?

Phil : Come on, Alex. Bus is leaving.

Manny : Good, great, couldn't be better. Can we, uh...

Alex : Dad, your phone's been buzzing like crazy.

Mitchell : Yes, we can, uh... all right.

Phil : Sweet Lorna Doone! 19 missed calls? I wonder who's... Phil
Dunphy. You saw the ad? Great. Do you know what you're
looking for? The little one? I think I know which one you're
talking about. Um, if you're interested, I also have an older model
with a lot of character. What? I think the carpet matches the
drapes. I haven't checked in a while. Both of them? Wow. Well, I
guess that makes sense if you're planning to flip one. Listen, um,
why don't I call you back? We'll set up an appointment. It'll give
me a chance to give them both a good scrubbing. All right. Thanks
a lot. Bye-bye. How about that, huh? You think all these calls are
about the ad?

Mitchell : What's up?
Manny : Okay, you got to talk to Cam. He's driving us crazy.
Kevin is biting his nails again, and Reuben hasn't had a bowel
movement in a week. Don't laugh. That's how Elvis died.
Mitchell : All right, um, Manny, I... I can't get involved. But... all
right, if you have to say something, just tell Bob Fussy that he's
overdoing it and you want to go back to your old stuff.

Alex : Yeah. My friend Nicole just sent me a picture of the van.

Cameron : Okay, break's over, people! I want to do the French
Revolution number again. Let's bring out the guillotine. Carefully
this time.

Phil : I guess I'll be seeing you Wednesdays and every other
weekend.

Manny : No, no, no.
Cameron : Excuse me?

Claire : Hello?

Manny : We don't want to do the new stuff. We want to stop
rehearsing and go back to the old way, Bob Fussy.

Phil : Okay, um, you sound very angry, which is completely
understandable.
Claire : I'm not angry. I'm just sitting here thinking about college
and how life has passed me by.

Mitchell : I... I don't know where this is coming from.
Cameron : You all feel this way?
Kids : Yeah.
Modern Family Season 2x19 page.5

Cameron : Well, I had no idea. I had no idea I was surrounded by
a bunch of quitters. This production was a joke until I introduced
these children to the musical-theater greats... Bernstein, Sondheim.
Years from now, some of these kids will still be talking about the
way I Sondheim-ized them.
Mitchell : Ooh, I'm don't think that's a good way of saying... okay.
Cameron : You want to do it the old way with the same tired
songs, the same drab choreography, the same tepid applause from
mom and dad? Is that what you want? Just say the word.
Kids : That's what we want.
Cameron : Well, too bad, people! We're doing it my way! From the
top! This is a closed rehearsal. March.
Claire : Hi, honey. What are you doing out here?
Phil : Oh, just waiting for you 'cause I love you. Haley, come out
this side.
Haley : Why?
Phil : 'Cause it's fun. Try it. Yeah, the doors slide, the seats slide.
What can't the Sienna do?
Haley : That was fun.
Phil : Right? Let's go see a show!

Claire : Really?
Phil : Yes, yes, for sure.
Claire : You feel good?
Phil : Yeah, I...
Cameron : Hello, and welcome, everyone. And latecomers. I hope
you enjoy the show tonight. I think you will agree it has a certain
flair that has been lacking from this stage in years past. So, please,
I invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy this musical trip around
the world!
Luke : Wow. Growing up in America sure is great, but I wish I
knew more about the world.
Delroy :: Me too.
Luke : I think I've got an idea. See you later, friend.
Delroy : Where are you going?
Luke : To see the world! China looks interesting. I think I'll land
here.
Cameron : Bring him down! Bring him down! Just go with it. Hit
it!

Claire : Sweetie, we need to close the door.

Donnie : Oh. Hey. Come on. Geez, come on, Jay. You're in the
theater. Try your jacket pocket.

Phil : Yeah, with the key. I like to see how far I can get from the car
and still make it work.

Jay : Sorry, folks. Nice. He taped it shut.

Claire : Listen, honey, honey.
Phil : Yeah?
Claire : Let me ask you something. Okay, I need you to be really
honest with me.
Phil : Yeah, you ca... yes.
Claire : Are my best years behind me?
Phil : What? No. The trick is to keep looking forward. Here we go.

Gloria : Okay, that's enough. Ay! Stupid! You too!
Jay : Don't hit him. He has cancer.
Gloria : What...
Claire : Oh, my God, is Luke stuck up there? Phil?
Phil : Come on. Yeah. Ye... oh, no. Come on!

Modern Family Season 2x19 page.6

Luke : China sure was fun. And look, there's merry old England.

Donnie : You son of a bitch.

Alex : Has anyone here ever seen a globe?

Cameron : Okay, all right. That one was my fault, but Joan of Arc's
gonna be just fine.

Manny : Full steam ahead! Ahead!
Cameron : Just sing.
Manny : Oh, joy to salt-swept eyes fair England, do I see...
Jay : Sorry about what I said to Gloria, okay? Just came out. Let's
go back inside.
Donnie : Hit me.
Jay : What?
Donnie : You heard me. Hit me.
Jay : I'm not gonna hit you, Donnie.
Donnie : Yeah, well, that's the whole damn point. As soon as you
heard I was sick, you treated me different. Let me tell you, I get
enough of that at home.
Jay : I'm sorry. I feel a little bad for you, okay? I know we don't say
this much, but, uh... I care for you, you know?
Donnie : Do you think I don't know that crap? I have known you
cared about me since we were 8 and 10 years old and that mook
Joey Calieri stole my bike and you put his head in the ice.
Jay : What was that he said again?
Donnie : Um, "I can't hear no more."
Jay : "I can't hear no more!" Oh, Don.
Mitchell : Your staging is all over the place. The kids are
exhausted. You're making it all about you. No intermission. What,
are we animals? I...
Donnie : I'm gonna be fine. I got great doctors. The kids call me
every day. Irene even lost 20 pounds due to stress.
Jay : Good for you. You promise me you'll get that liver checked
out. Ah, there's nothing wr... Come on, Donna. Suck it up. We're
missing my kid's show.

Manny : It's not gonna be much fun doing the show without
Emma.
Delroy : Maybe we should just stop this.
Cameron : No. No. There is a saying in the theater world that...
Manny : "It's not worth dying for"?
Cameron : No, it's that "endings make shows." And we've got a
great ending. Now get out there and sing your hearts out. Oh, not
you, sweetie. You just mouth the words. Okay.
Luke : Uncle Cam, both my legs are tingly.
Cameron : Okay, we'll cut you down in just a second, Luke, okay?
The show must go on. Have fun with it.
Luke : Learning about the world sure was fun. But I'm glad to
have my feet back on the ground again. Oh, Egypt is a land where
the pyramids stand which were built by industrious Jews and
windmills go around in Holland town where they all wear
wooden shoes these are the things we learned today and there's
one last thing we want to say
Claire : "We love the word"
Cameron : Where's the "L"?
Manny : That's Luke.
Cameron : Lower the insignia. Lower it.
Jay : "We love the... " What the hell?
Cameron : No, no, no. No, no. No, no, no. No. No, no, no. No.
Mitchell : Brava!
Claire : Phil, where have you been?
Phil : Oh, just getting some fresh air.
Modern Family Season 2x19 page.7

Claire : Honey.
Phil : Got it. Ready to go? Hey, look up at the moon. Would you
say that's waxing or waning? Who cares? We can spend all night
looking...
Claire : "I can't be satisfied"?! My God, Phil. That makes me look
like a prostitute.
Phil : No.

Phil : Well, I don't know. There were 30 calls. You got 20 or 25 of
them.
Claire : And they... ask for me?
Phil : They asked for the hot blonde.
Claire : Hmm. Men are pigs. Did they call me anything else?

Claire : Yes. Yes, it does.

Claire : So, thanks to all the perverts in town, I realized I still have
a few good years ahead of me.

Phil : More of an escort, really. You're just selling your time.
Whereas a prostitute just...

Phil : And if we have one person to thank for that, it would be me.

Claire : Okay, Phil. I have been driving around in this all day.
Phil : Well, since you're mad already, why don't you just step over
here and have a look at that?
Claire : Oh, God. My baby.
Haley : I am not getting back in that car!
Claire : Oh, how do you think you're gonna get home, honey?

Claire : No.
Cameron : Was it as awful as I think?
Mitchell : Take the flowers.
Cameron : It must have been really hard for you to be supportive
while I made a fool out of myself.

Haley : It doesn't matter! I'll go home with anyone!

Mitchell : Oh, come here. Luke, do you mind? We're trying to
have a moment here.

Alex : That's what it should say on the van.

Luke : I can feel my heartbeat in my eyes.

Claire : Alex. I can't believe we trusted you to put this on the car
after the debacle of that last picture.

Cameron : In his eyes?

Phil : Damn it.
Claire : And that... who was that?

Mitchell : Yes. Okay. We'll get a janitor.
Cameron : Okay.

Phil : Probably another...
Alex : I think the word you're looking for is "John."
Claire : Get in the minivan. You mean to tell me that people have
actually been calling about this?
Phil : There are a lot of creeps out there.
Claire : That's disgusting. She's a child.
Phil : Well, to be fair, most of them were for you.
Claire : Well, it's still sick. What do you mean, "most"?

Modern Family
2x20 : Someone To Watch Over Lily

Phil : Good for you, buddy.
Alex : Mom! No one heard me screaming?! I've been trapped in
the garage for like 20 minutes!

Jay : Want some coffee?

Claire : And yet still you didn't get the rat traps I sent you for.

Manny : Say yes. It's French press. I was doubtful, too, but I
honestly can't see myself going back to drip.

Alex : Oh!

Jay : I'm so happy you don't live in a tough neighborhood
anymore.

Phil : Come on, now! Every morning?!

Mitchell : We're so sorry for just dropping by like this.

Mitchell : Did we come at a bad time?

Gloria : Are you kidding me? I'll take any chance to spend time
with this little princess. I love her little hair, her little toes.

Claire : Come back in seven years and five months, when they're
all gone!

Claire : Thank you. Honey, it's doing it again!
Haley : I hope the whole house burns down!

Cameron : And she loves her grandmother.
Gloria : I don't love "grandmother."

[OPENING CREDITS]

Mitchell : So, Cam and I have been revising our will to specify
who should take care of Lily if, God forbid, something happened
to us.

Cameron : So, mama, you're good for coal?! Okay, okay! Well, you
bundle up! We don't want to lose you! Okay. Yeah, bye! They're in
the middle of a terrible blizzard.

Cameron : God forbid.

Jay : So you shouted!

Mitchell : I said "God for..." So, we've been dropping by
unannounced to, you know, casually assess our candidates.

Manny : Did they really lose two cows?

Cameron : Not all of our candidates.
Mitchell ! No, t... that's true. We did not drop by Missour-ah.
Cameron : It's "Missouri." No one from Missouri would say
"Missour-ah."
Mitchell : I'm so sorr-ah. So, anyway, Claire and Phil were our first
thought, so we dropped by their place last week.
Haley : You win the award for worst mother ever!
Claire : I will be sure to thank you in my speech! Phil, the frying
pan's on fire!
Phil : Son of Jor-El! Everybody stay calm!
Luke : Dad, I'm gonna teach myself how to juggle.

Cameron : Oh, yeah, frozen solid. Mama's gonna send pictures.
Mitchell : Oh, yay, a reason to stop by the frame store.
Jay : Manny, I got to get you down to that sporting-goods place.
Got to get him some stuff for his weekend outing.
Manny : Ready!
Jay : Did you pee?
Manny : Not ready.
Cameron : Jay, would you mind if we came?
Jay : Sure, why not?
Cameron : You know, I'd like to get mama some snowshoes... You
know, to lift her spirits, what with all the frozen cows and all.
Modern Family Season 2x20 page.1

Mitchell : So, cows freeze now? Are we all just accepting that?
Cameron : Oh, yeah, absolutely. Jay, this one time...

trouble concentrating in school. I just want to make sure that he's...
normal.

Jay : We'll take two cars.
Gloria : If you want, I can stay with the little princess.

Luke : Hey, mom, check it out.

Mitchell : Oh, that... that's a great idea.

Claire : What are you doing?

Cameron : Oh, yeah, I'll just... I'll just go out and get her bag.

Luke : If I move my head fast enough, it looks like the can is
standing still.

Gloria : Maybe I can take her to the mall, buy her a new outfit, get
her some hair rings... Is that okay?

Claire : 'Cause sometimes I wonder.

Mitchell : Yes, yes, of course. Um, you know, Gloria, Cam and I
were talking about what would happen to Lily if anything were
ever to happen to us, and we were thinking...

Phil : But all the girls at work love it when I bring Luke by,
especially that receptionist Heather, right, buddy?

Gloria : Oh, my God. ¡sí, sí, sí! I take her!

Claire : Mm. Well, honey, you're gonna have to smell daddy's
receptionist some other time.

Mitchell : Okay, well, that's very sweet, but you realize it would
only happen...

Luke : She smells amazing.

Luke : Like peaches.

Gloria : I can't wait!

Claire : If you're both going out, who's taking me to cello?

Mitchell : Okay, well, hopefully, it's a long shot.

Luke : One time, she gave me a Woody.

Gloria : Ay, a little girl!

Claire : Sweet Je...

Mitchell : There would have to be a very tragic accident.
Gloria : I know, I know. Nothing is going to happen.

Luke : She remembered he's my favorite character from "Toy
Story."

Mitchell : Oh.

Claire : She did. Uh... Haley, how are you getting to the mall?

Gloria : But if it did, we would be so happy! ¡Ay!

Haley : Uh, Gabby's picking me up.

Phil : So, what do you say, pal? I got to swing by the office. You
want to come along?

Claire : Okay, you're gonna drop your sister off at her cello lesson
first.

Claire : Can't. We got some stuff to do.

Haley : No way. She plays lacrosse and takes cello lessons. Even
my reputation can't handle that dork hit.

Phil : What?
Claire : Just errands.
Phil : Oh.
Claire : I'm taking Luke to see a child psychologist. This is
something that Phil would never agree to. He's doesn't want Luke
to feel... different. But Luke's grades aren't great, and he's having

Claire : Okay, well, then you don't need to go snowboarding with
your friends on break.
Haley : Fine, I'll take her. Just never look my friends in the eye,
and only speak in emergencies.
Alex : Got it.
Haley : Ah! Already failed.
Modern Family Season 2x20 page.2

Phil : Honey, after I go by the office, maybe we can grab some
lunch.
Claire : Oh, I can't. I got to pick up all that stuff for the school trip.
But you know what? I'll see you tonight at dad and Gloria's.

Haley : Tell me.
Gabby : When you and Dylan were broken up, Rachel told him
you were a skank and got all up on him.
Haley : No! But she's so nice to me.

Phil : Okay.

Gabby : To your face. That's how she plays.

Luke : Smell Heather for me.

Haley : Well, now she's gonna see how we play. What are we
gonna do?

Phil : I always do... not.

Alex : She's not there. You're just gonna have to take me home.
Dr. Klausner : Ms. Dunphy?

Haley : We don't have time. We have stuff to do.

Claire : Hi, Dr. Klausner. I am so sorry we're late. We just got a
little bit caught up in...

Alex : Then I'm just gonna have to come with you.

Dr. Klausner : Oh, no, it's okay. It's okay. It gave me a chance to
chat with your husband.

Haley : What, so she gets kidnapped and I get in trouble? No,
thank you. Okay, fine, you can come with us, but you have to keep
your mouth shut about anything you see.

Phil : Hello, Claire.
Dr. Klausner : So, Luke, come on in with me. Mom and dad, we'll
let you know when we need you.

Gabby : Can't we just drop her off at a coffee shop or something?

Gabby : What's she gonna see?
Haley : Just drive!

Phil : Go get 'em, pal.
Claire : How did you...
Phil : How did I what? Know you were someplace you left no
trace of except for a tiny notation in your calendar? It was quite
simple, really. I noticed a tiny nota... Shoot.
Alex : That's weird. My cello teacher's car's in here. I wonder if
she's not home.
Haley : Okay, so go knock on the door, Alan Einstein.
Alex : Don't leave. And it's "Albert."

Cameron : Ooh, maybe I should also get a gift for my aunt Pat.
Have I ever told you about her? Total gun nut, lives completely off
the grid.
Mitchell : Did you see how cute Gloria was with Lily?
Cameron : Oh, Pat is hilarious. I don't think she's paid taxes in 20
years, but very hospitable. Always has a deer in the freezer.
Mitchell : Would you listen to me? I think that Gloria and my dad
could be Lily's guardians.

Haley : I know. Alan's his dorky brother who played the cello.

Cameron : Look, you know I love Jay, and they're still in the mix,
but I just don't know about him raising a child.

Alex : Good one.

Mitchell : Well, Cam, he raised me.

Gabby : I should probably not be telling you this.

Cameron : Well, now you've put me in an awkward position. Oh,
look at that. That's adorable.

Haley : What?
Gabby : Nothing. It's really bad.

Modern Family Season 2x20 page.3

Jay : Let's see if we can get you some snow pants.
Manny : I just wish I felt better. I think I'm coming down with flulike symptoms.
Jay : Couple of hours before your camping trip, huh?
Manny : I want to go. It's just, if I'm sick, I might get the
chaperones sick, and without chaperones, it's anarchy.

Phil : Look, he starts coming here, the other kids find out, he
becomes a target, like that limping gazelle at the watering hole
that the alligator knows to eat.
Claire : They're crocodiles, not alligators. There are no alligators in
Africa.
Phil : How about at the zoo? Bam! Who needs a shrink now?

Jay : Manny, listen to me.

Dr. Klausner : Mr. and Mrs. Dunphy?

Manny : The buddy system falls apart, the principle of "last in,
first out" is ignored.

Claire : Yes? Hi.

Jay : It's butterflies.
Manny : Where?
Jay : You're just nervous because there's gonna be a lot of physical
activity, which is not exactly your strong suit.
Manny : It is a little daunting out there.
Jay : D... don't use the word "daunting" in nature, okay? You just
need a little self-confidence. Look at this. They got one of these
rock walls here. Why don't you hop up on that?

Dr. Klausner : Luke, I'm gonna talk to your mom and dad for a
minute, okay?
Luke : Okay. She's, like, the best doctor ever. A couple of puzzles,
no shots. I didn't even have to take my pants off. Found that one
out a little late.
Phil : I've been there, buddy.
Claire : Mwah!
Dr. Klausner : Well, Luke's a terrific kid. I have a few thoughts,
but, honestly, I don't see anything that's cause for alarm.

Manny : Why?

Phil : Awesome. Thanks so much for your time.

Jay : Why? To prove that you can do it. If you can do that, you can
do anything.

Claire : We... we would love to hear your thoughts.

Manny : Really? Can I fly? Can I speak Chinese?
Jay : No, but you can sleep in the house tonight. Ace? Want to wire
my boy up, here? Go ahead.

Dr. Klausner : Well... he's a bright and curious boy, but he gets
distracted.
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Phil : Mm-hmm.
Dr. Klausner : I see it all the time with above-average kids.

Claire : I'm sorry I went behind your back. But you get so
defensive whenever we talk about Luke's issues.
Phil : He doesn't have issues. You're just a worrier. Like when you
thought he was never gonna talk.

Claire : Mm-hmm. Phil, honey, I want you to hear this.
Dr. Klausner : They're a little overstimulated because there are so
many things they're interested in. They never seem to focus.
Claire : Makes me crazy.

Claire : He was 2, and all he could do was bark!

Phil : Too crazy.

Phil : I understood him.

Dr. Klausner : Well, they usually do outgrow it.

Claire : Phil!

Claire : What if they don't?
Modern Family Season 2x20 page.4

Dr. Klausner : He will. Well, there's... there's medication, but why
don't we cross that bridge if we come to it?

from her stripper pole... "Thanks, gay dead dads. This dance is for
you." Excuse me, Jay?

Claire : Is there any way to avoid that bridge altogether? You
know, maybe there's diet or... or focusing exercises or something?

Manny : I'm getting down.

Dr. Klausner : Mrs. Dunphy, what exactly are you worried about?

Cameron : Well, maybe if we didn't bully Manny so much, but,
rather, showed him, he wouldn't be so afraid. Excuse me, sherpa,
can you assist me with the harness?

Phil : Get comfortable.
Claire : I'm worried he's turning into you, Phil.

Jay : Not till you touch the top! What is it?

Claire : I knew the minute I opened my mouth that I was in the
wrong, but, honestly, sometimes I wonder about him.

Phil : Oh, no. Which one of these is my driving machine?

Luke : Hey, mom, check it out.

Phil : Funny, I thought that was my problem... I came out wrong.
Hold on. Oh, good, I can walk again.

Claire : What are you doing?

Claire : Phil, I already apologized. It just... it came out wrong.

Luke : If I move my head fast enough, it looks like the can is
standing still.

Claire : Honey, you know, sometimes you can act a little bit...

Phil : He's totally right!

Claire : Phil, when you are ready to talk to me like an adult, why
don't you let me know?

Cameron : I just find it interesting that you blame Jay for
everything from your night terrors to your shy bladder, and now
he's the perfect guardian for Lily.

Phil : Fine. Okay, okay. The adults are the big ones, right?

Mitchell : No, not perfect, and... and I never said anything about
my shy bladder.

Cameron : Now, I know it seems daunting, Manny, but it's very
simple. I'm securely hitched to a rope, which means I'm not going
to fall.

Cameron : O... oh. Then why did I have to stand guard outside the
bathroom at Pepper's three faces of new year's Eve party?

Phil : Oh, no! Where did everyone go?! Oh, just a blink.

Luke : Hey, how do you think that got up there? Uh-oh.

Mitchell : You know, dad, you're really making my life difficult
right now.

Jay : Damn it, Manny! Move it! Go!

Jay : How?

Manny : It's scary.

Mitchell : By barking at Manny like a drill sergeant when I'm
trying to convince Cam that you'd be a great guardian for Lily.

Jay : You're 2 feet off the ground. I've seen vines climb walls faster
than that. Move your butt!
Cameron : Oh, well, there's your esteem-building parent right
there. Wait, wait, I think I hear future Lily sending us a message

Jay : Guardian?
Mitchell : Yeah.
Jay : You're kidding.
Cameron : Aah! Jay!
Modern Family Season 2x20 page.5

Mitchell : Yeah, never mind.
Cameron : That really hurt!

Cameron : Do not minimize it, you, who I had to rush to the
emergency room that time you fell out of your clogs.
Jay : There's your bubbly water with lemon.

Alex : This is a mistake.

Cameron : Thank you, Jay.

Gabby : Why does she keep saying that?

Jay : How you doin'?

Haley : Because they're the first words she ever heard.

Cameron : Oh, it's hard to tell. You know, anytime you have a
catastrophic injury to your lumbar area...

Gabby : Here, you go first.
Haley : This will teach that skank a lesson.
Alex : Shaving cream in her locker?
Haley : Just stand over there and yell if someone's coming.
Alex : She might have homework assignments in there she hasn't
handed in yet. Haley! Someone's coming!
Haley : Run! This way, this way!
Alex : Okay, okay, okay! Where are we?
Haley : Boys' locker room.
Alex : It smells like feet.
Haley : That's not feet. Okay.
Alex : I'm so scared.
Haley : Just go to your happy place.
Alex : We just broke into my happy place.
Guardian : Who's there?
Haley : Shh, shh, shh, shh! Go, go, run, run! Not so loud! Run!
Run!
Mitchell : So, how you doing?
Cameron : Oh, not good. I'm just glad my clown training prepared
me to take a fall like that.
Mitchell : Yeah, and in terms of talking about it, are we looking at
weeks, months?

Jay : I could use a little piece of lumbar myself right now.
Cameron : Well, I hope you're comfortable now making my family
Lily's guardians.
Gloria : ¡Hola, hola!
Mitchell : You're forgetting about Gloria. Even you have to admit
how amazing she is with Lily.
Gloria : Mm! Look who's so pretty!
Cameron : Oh, my God!
Mitchell : Gloria, what did you do?
Gloria : What I told you.
Cameron : You pierced her ears?!
Gloria : What I said... I was going to make her pretty with
earrings.
Mitchell : I thought you said "hair rings."
Gloria : What are hair rings?
Cameron : Yes, Mitchell, what are hair rings?
Mitchell : Something that you would tie your hair back... She said
it!
Gloria : I didn't say "hair rings." I said "earrings." You don't like?
Cameron : Of course not. You punctured our daughter! Oh!
Gloria : But did you see both sides? I didn't just do the gay ear.
Look.
Mitchell : Oh, my God.
Modern Family Season 2x20 page.6

Haley : I actually... I think we're good. Let's just wait in here for
Gabby, okay?

Claire : Phil, I'm just not sure you understand why I said what I
said.

Alex : Oh, my God! I can't believe we just did that. Can you
believe we just did that?

Phil : There are qualities about me you wish you could change,
but you can't 'cause I'm all grown up, but it's not too late for Luke.

Haley : Yeah, we had a lot of fun. Let's not geek it up.
Alex : Wait. What if I have a taste for it now? Am I gonna start
doing stuff like that all the time?

Claire : Okay. Honey, there are a hundred things about Luke that
he gets from you that I absolutely love. It's just this... this one tiny
part that I'm sure if I could just get in there and just... ee!

Haley : Calm down. You just did one bad thing.

Phil : Claire... he's a great kid. He's gonna be fine.

Alex : Two. I skipped my cello lesson today. That wasn't even
where my teacher lives.

Claire : I know. I think I know. I feel terrible that we fought in
front of him. Did he say anything about that on the drive here?

Haley : You ditched a class?

Phil : How would I know? He rode with you.

Alex : Well, I... I didn't have time to practice because of lacrosse
and debate team and...

Claire : He didn't drive with me. He drove with you.

Haley : Do you even like playing the cello?
Alex : Yeah.
Haley : Alex?
Alex : I hate it.
Haley : So quit.
Alex : I've never quit anything.
Haley : You've never broke into a school before. Just did that.
Alex : No offense, but the family's hopes and dreams are kind of
pinned on me.
Haley : I'm just saying that no one would blame you if you
stopped being so perfect. It actually would take a lot of pressure
off of me. I did something bad, too... Something that nobody
knows.

Cameron : Just admit it... you want Lily raised by anyone but my
family.
Mitchell : It's just so far away from everything she knows. And
then there's the crazy aunts and the frozen cows.
Cameron : Oh, please, in the last hour, your father publicly
shamed Manny, dropped me from the sky, while his wife drilled
holes in our baby's head. Oh!
Mitchell : Which is why I think we should revisit Claire and Phil.
Claire : Where are my keys?
Phil : We left Luke alone in a parking garage!
Mitchell : We don't know the whole story.
Cameron : Don't we?
Phil : Whose car are we taking?
Claire : Mine.

Alex : What?

Phil : Then I'm driving!

Haley : Come here. I can't say it too loud, okay?

Luke : Hey, mom.

Alex : What did you do?

Phil : Buddy!
Claire : Luke?
Phil : Buddy! Lukey?
Modern Family Season 2x20 page.7

Claire : Thank you so much. Honey, get out of there.
Phil : Thank you! I'm so sorry.
Claire : We are so sorry.
Phil : Oh, buddy, you must've been so scared.
Luke : No.
Claire : Oh, God.
Phil : Well, what happened?
Luke : Well, I knew you'd come back. Then you didn't. So I had to
go find a phone. That's when I saw a stray dog and I played with
him for a while. Then I thought I saw Mrs. Morgan, my first-grade
teacher, going into a church. It wasn't her, but there was a
wedding there. That's where I met the Litvaks.

Cameron : Now, that's not anything you need to worry about,
Manny.
Manny : I just think you're being too hard on him. We had a little
chat in the car.
Manny : I'm sorry I let you down, Jay. I'm starting to think if I
couldn't even get up that wall, then why am I even going on this...
Jay : Knock it off, Manny. We both know you could get up that
wall. Now, why are you trying to get out of this trip?
Manny : I'm not. I'm excited to go...
Jay : Manny...
Manny : Okay. I have some concerns about the shower situation.

Phil : Oh, thank you! Thank you so much. Congratul... tov. Mwah!

Jay : Oh. Because?

Claire : Oh, baby.

Manny : Well, I'm pretty much at my target weight.

Luke : Can I go get a drink?

Jay : That's good.

Claire : Yes, you can.

Manny : But the thing is, I haven't quite reached my target height.

Phil : Yes, you can! You can drink whatever you want! Of course
you can. There's tons of soda in there. Ohh!

Jay : All right, first of all, you don't have to go. I'll write you a
note. We'll plan on doing something fun this weekend.

Claire : What an amazing kid! I can't believe I ever worried about
him out in the world. That's what I do, though, isn't it? I worry. I
worry... I think about a tiny, little thing, and then I obsess on it,
until, suddenly, it's the only thing I can think about. God, please
don't let me screw up our son.

Manny : Really?

Phil : Hey, hey. You know why else he's gonna be okay?
Claire : No.
Phil : Because somewhere out there is a worried little girl who's
making lists and labeling bins, and he's gonna find her.
Manny : Cam? I know you're kind of down on Jay being Lily's
guardian.

Jay : You bet.
Manny : And you're not mad at me?
Jay : Look, if you were a different kid, I'd give you the speech...
You know, "we all have insecurities. You've got to be brave here."
But let's face it... you're already about the bravest kid I know.
Manny : I am?
Jay : Come on. You wear blazers to school. You play the pan flute.
You... you read poetry to girls. I couldn't even talk to girls when I
was your age. The shower thing's nothing compared to all that. So,
whatever you decide, I'm behind you. No, I got that set up just
right. I told you about that before.

Modern Family Season 2x20 page.8

Cameron : Jay said that?
Manny : Yeah, and he wasn't drinking or anything.

Claire : I don't mean to ruin this really beautiful moment, but were
Phil and I even considered for the position?

Cameron : So, what are you gonna do?

Phil : Claire?

Manny : I think I'm gonna go. I mean, if Reuben can go with that
extra nipple...

Claire : I mean, we are the parents of three healthy, well-adjusted
children who...

Cameron : I'm proud of you, Manny. You're doing the right thing,
trust me.

Phil : Honey, we need to go down to the police station. Our
daughters just vandalized the school.
Claire : This is not over.

Mitchell : I mean, what were you thinking, Gloria?

Gloria : Let's go see your new room, Liliana.

Gloria : Ay, Mitch, I said I was sorry. But I had them since I was 2...
huge ones.

Mitchell : No, that's not her name.

Phil : What is she...

Mitchell : Hey.

Claire : Earrings, Phil. Earrings.

Cameron : Oh, hey, what are you doing home?

Jay : Mitch, I just wanted to tell you how really touched I was
you'd want me to be Lily's guardian.

Mitchell : Oh, I bailed on yoga.

Mitchell : Oh, you're welcome. And you're out.

Cameron : Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, could you go to the mailbox
and get me...

Cameron : Excuse me. I have a very important announcement to
make.

Mitchell : No, why can't I just come in?

Phil : Oh. Sorry. Sorry, so rude. Totally inexcusable. Yello!

Mitchell : Cameron?

Cameron : Mitchell and I have decided that if, God forbid,
anything should happen to us...

Cameron : What?

Mitchell : You don't have to do this right now.
Cameron : No. We would like to Jay and Gloria to be Lily's
guardians.
Mitchell : Cam?
Cameron : It's the right decision.
Gloria : That is great news! Lily, when something horrible
happens, you're going to be all mine!
Mitchell : It really is an "if" situation.
Gloria : All mine!

Cameron : You can. I just...

Mitchell : Look at me.
Cameron : I am.
Mitchell : What did you do?
Cameron : I am home alone for a lot of hours.
Mitchell : Carmen Miranda?
Cameron : I just wanted a couple before the holes closed up.
Mitchell : Oh, Cameron. Oh. All right, just get one with me really
quick.
Cameron : Okay. All right. Hey! One for daddy! Whoo!

2x21 : Mother's Day
Phil : Okay. Here she comes.
Kids : Happy mother's day! Aahhhh!
Haley : What are you wearing?
Claire : You don't remember this shirt? You made it for me for
mother's day in kindergarten. It's adorable.

Manny : I know they're not exactly diamonds, mom.
Gloria : No, they're beautiful.
Jay : You know what? I got a confession to make. Those aren't real
diamonds. No. Here, give them back. I'll get you some real ones
later.
Manny : Dang it. Now I got to come clean. These aren't real froot
loops. They're generic.
Gloria : Hey. Now I have no presents again.

Haley : It's perverted. It looks like you were felt up by that creepy
guy around the corner.

Mitchell : Good morning!

Alex : Ew! Why him?

Cameron : He-e-e-y! Hey, what's this?

Haley : 'Cause he's got, like, freakishly tiny hands.

Mitchell : Well, I know you've had some late nights with Lily, and
this is just my way of saying "thank you" and "I love you."

Phil : Thank you!
Haley : I cannot believe you kept that shirt.
Claire : Of course I kept it. I'm your mother. I keep everything you
make me.
Alex : Please take that off.
Claire : Oh, when I'm dead. Today is my special day, and I am
gonna enjoy me some coffee.

Cameron : Oh, thank you.
Mitchell : And this is just the beginning. Yeah, 'cause today is your
day.
Cameron : Today?
Mitchell : All day.
Cameron : Today. Today is my day.

Luke : You know that's a pencil holder, right?

Mitchell : Something's happening.

Claire : Oh, I do now.

Cameron : It mother's day, Mitchell.

Jay : Go first.

Mitchell : So?

Manny : No, you can go first.

Cameron : You're bringing me breakfast in bed on mother's day.

Jay : Manny, go first!

Mitchell : Okay, no, no, this is not a mother's day breakfast.

Manny : No, Jay, you go first.

Cameron : This is breakfast that happens to be on... You think of
me as Lily's mother! I'm your wife! I'm a woman!!

Gloria : Ah, somebody give me a present! Oh, Jay, a diamond
necklace! Thank you!

Mitchell : What?

Jay : You deserve it. Go ahead, kid.
Manny : Happy mother's day, mom.
Gloria : Oh. A necklace made of the froot loops! I love it!

Mitchell : Honestly, I'm a little offended that he accused me of
that. I'm actually very sensitive to that issue. Like I would ever
treat my partner as a woman.
Modern Family Season 2x21 page.1

Claire : Somebody got new curtains.
Mitchell : Well, Mrs. Pritchett loves to shop. Oh, we're never
gonna be done by 6:00. Better call home. The wife's not gonna like
this.

Manny : I'm not sure that's true. And how are you gonna fend
them off with a popsicle stick?
Luke : It's a spear. And it smells like lemon-lime, a flavor coyotes
hate.
Manny : Where are you getting your information?
Alex : How much farther?

Mitchell : Sometimes I think he just wants to be mad at me.

Claire : Well, I'd like to go far enough that we can't still see our car
in the parking lot.

Cameron : I can't eat!

Haley : I'm getting dust in my mouth.

Mitchell : Okay, you know what? If you can't accept the nice
gesture, then just forget it. Okay, scratch the balloons. She is in a
mood.

Gloria : You have to appreciate nature.
Claire : Yes.
Gloria : Soon, this will be the mall.
Haley : I'll come then.

[OPENING CREDITS]

Luke : I'm hungry. I say we eat what we kill.
Manny : Oh, then I guess we'll be eating the mood.

Phil : I asked Claire what she wanted for mother's day, and she
said, "take a hike." It's not like that. She's... she's just bananas for
walking around in nature. Um, so, she and... and Gloria are taking
the kids up the canyon um, and Jay and I are, uh, throwing on the
aprons and preparing a mother day feast. It's... it's gonna be fun.

Luke : I don't get you at all.
Manny : I know.
Alex : Ugh.
Mitchell : Oh, is that the party over there?

Phil : ♪ I know you want to leave me ♪ but I refuse to...
Jay : We're not doing that.
Luke : You know there are coyotes in these woods? Did you pack a
weapon?
Manny : I have a walking stick.
Luke : Does it become a sword?
Manny : I guess it could become a running stick.
Luke : All right, you're gonna outrun a coyote? The fastest
mammal in the world?

Cameron : I don't know. I'm a woman, remember? I have a terrible
sense of direction.
Mitchell : May I remind you that my big crime was making you
fluffy pancakes, okay? I'm getting a little sick of you dwelling on
this. It happens to be mother's day, not martyr's day.
Cameron : Mitchell. I'm sorry. It's just a sensitive issue for me.
Mitchell : Okay.
Cameron : There's nothing gays hate more than when people...
Treat us like women.
Mitchell : ...treat us like women.

We don't have a time of the month. We don't love pink.

Jen : You're an honorary mom!

Mitchell : Well, you love pink.

Rick : Get over there. That's... that's... Okay, tighten up, tighten up.
Up here, ladies! Beautiful. One more, gals. Oh, thanks, ladies.
Thanks so much. Perfect.

Cameron : No, pink loves me.
Mitchell : Okay.
Jen : Hey, guys!
Mitchell : Hey! So...
Cameron : That's Jen, husband Rick, baby Diego. I don't get it
either.

Cameron : Oh, I don't know. Uh, okay, all right. Unhand me.

Manny : Yeah, that was definitely poison oak. I think this rash is
spreading.
Gloria : Manny, that's not a rash. It's red because you scratch it.
Manny : I just don't want my throat to close.

Mitchell : Hey, Jen. Let me help you with that.

Luke : Wouldn't be the worst thing.

Jen : Oh.

Haley : I'm so bored, I'd rather be reading.

Mitchell : Rick! How you doing?

Alex : I'm so bored, I chewed the last bug that flew in my mouth
just to feel something.

Jen : We should do play group on weekends more often. It's nice
to have the husbands around to help, right?
Cameron : Oh, yeah, because that makes all the sense in the
world... you as the husband.
Mitchell : Stop it. That's not what she meant.
Cameron : Look at us. I could snap you like a twig.
Mitchell : Okay, every once in a while you say that thing about the
twig, and I need you to know that it bothers me.

Haley : I'm so bored, I'm talking to you.
Claire : Ugh! Okay! For the last 20 minutes, all you people have
done is whine! You would think on mother's day, at least, you
would have something nice to say...
Luke : Shh!
Claire : What?
Luke : Thought I heard a coyote. Go ahead.

Cameron : Sorry.

Alex : God, Luke, you're such an idiot.

Rick : Okay, everybody, happy mother's day! I know I speak for all
the guys when I say thank you for everything you do while we're
off having affairs. I'm kidding. I'll pay for that later. Uh, let's get
the moms and kids together for a picture!

Luke : At least I don't look like an idiot.

Cameron : No, let's go. Let's get out of here. Leave the stroller and
run.

Manny : Can we watch the language?

Mitchell : Cam, stop. No one's going to ask you to...
Jen : Cameron, get on up here.

Alex : What does that mean?
Haley : Your hat. It's like you walked under a bird that poops ugly
hats.
Haley : There's nothing else to watch.
Gloria : Enough complaining! You can't bitch all day because
you're not at the beach all day. Come on.

Cameron : I don't know. You guys just go ahead.
Modern Family Season 2x21 page.3

Claire : No. No, no. I-I'm giving myself a mother's day present.
Kids, your hike is over.

Phil : What's that, Francis?

Kids : Yes! Yeah!

Phil : Aw. I love the part about "serves one small boy." That's
adorable. Wow. "175 pounds of tenderness." She must have loved
that. Big woman? Jay?

Claire : No! No, not happy. Bad. Sad. Mm. Gloria and I are gonna
go finish this beautiful hike together while you sit here and think
about how selfish and thoughtless you've been. Come on.
Alex : If we're thoughtless, how can we think?

Jay : Nothing. How much longer on the meat?

Phil : And that's when I saw it.

Claire : You just lost your water. Let's go.
Phil : Jay... Are... are you crying?
Jay : What the hell are those?

Jay : No! It's the onions, damn it. Give me these.

Phil : Onion goggles. No more tears when I cook. Welcome to the
21st century. You should get a pair.

Phil : What are you lookin' at?

Jay : I was gonna suggest the same thing.
Phil : Hey, Jay, you know what we should put in this? We should
add a da...
Jay : No. It's my mom's recipe. What it says on the page goes in the
pot. Nothing more, nothing less. Now, how long do I stir the beef
and sausages? Read it to me.
Phil : You should stir the beef and sausages for five minutes.
Jay : And how much longer do I have to listen to the Julia Child
impression?
Phil : For as long as it's still funny.
Jay : I think the timer just went off on that.
Phil : That was unnecessary. What's this? What?! Hey, Jay, maybe
after this, we should make "The perfect mom." All we need is "a
tablespoon of love, 1 cup of warmth, add one heart, softened."
Jay : What the hell are you talking about?
Phil : This recipe for the perfect mom, by Jay Francis Pritchett, age
nine.
Jay : Geez, I forgot all about that. I didn't know she had that in
there.

Jay : Nothing.
Phil : Those really frame your face.
Claire : Oh. Wow. Beautiful.
Gloria : Ay, thank you.
Claire : Okay, I don't want you to judge me, but I have to say
something. Sometimes, I want to punch my kids.
Gloria : You don't mean that.
Claire : No, I do. I do. The last time they were horrible the way
they were today, they happened to be all lined up. And I couldn't
help but think, "if I hit just one of them, the rest would go down
like dominos."
Gloria : Eee.
Claire : I know. That would rob me of the pleasure of hitting each
one individually, but...
Gloria : Oh, my God, you don't talk about your children this way.
Claire : Oh, come on. You know Manny irritates you.
Gloria : No. Manny is the best thing that ever happened to me. We
have a special bond.

Modern Family Season 2x21 page.4

Claire : Yes, bonds. I know. But that's not what I'm talking about
now.

Luke : Book? Wake up and smell the Internet, grandma.

Gloria : Claire, for a long time, it was only the two of us. I cannot
say anything bad about that boy.

Luke : Well, we did kind of ruin her mother's day.

Claire : Give a break, Gloria! Anybody who's ever had a kid
knows that they can irritate the freaking life out of you at some
point. Am I right? Oh. Okay.

Haley : You know mom's just gonna want us to apologize.
Haley : No, she ruined her mother's day. She took us to a place she
knew we wouldn't like. And then we complain for like a second,
and we're the bad guys?

Gloria : He's persnickety.

Alex : That's a good point. You ever get the feeling she does this
intentionally?

Claire : What?

Luke : Why would she do that?

Gloria : Manny. He's persnickety. It drives me up the wall.

Haley : So she can make us feel guilty.

Claire : Okay, persnickety. Good start.

Alex : Exactly. And the next time we're choosing what to do, she
gets her way again. And the next time and the next time. And
eventually, it's mother's day every day.

Gloria : He follows me around all the time. Sometimes I love it,
but sometimes I need my own space.
Claire : This does not make you a bad mother to admit these
things.

Luke : Wow. Mom's really smart.

Gloria : And the poetry. It's not very good. Ah. First time that I say
that out loud.

Alex : Well...

Haley : Well, not smarter than me.

Claire : Okay.

Haley : I say we don't apologize this time, let her know we're onto
her little game.

Gloria : It's not very good!

Alex : We could change the way this whole family operates.

Claire : Wow.

Haley : Okay, so nobody says they're sorry. Got it? Keep your
mouths shut when she comes back.

Gloria : I-I love Manny, but, you know, sometimes I... just be a
boy! Go outside. Kick a ball. Steal something.

Luke : If she comes back.

Claire : Oh.
Gloria : It feels so good!
Manny : Maybe to you.
Gloria : No, Manny! Ay! I was talking about another Manny that I
know long time ago! Diablo! Manny!
Luke : You know, more people have died hiking than in the entire
civil war?

Phil : Jay teared up in front of me. He'd never shown me that kind
of vulnerability, and it embarrassed him. I'd shamed the proud
lion. Only thing to do... hug the proud lion. Oh, I could get bit. I
could get scratched. But you know what's inside every lion? A
pussycat.
Jay : I need you to get away from me.

Alex : Ok, what book did you read that in?
Modern Family Season 2x21 page.5

Phil : Yep. Okay, I'm just gonna say this one time so we can move
on. It's okay.

Boy : Excuse me. Can you throw that ball?

Jay : Gotcha.

Cameron : Can I throw a ball? You don't... you don't think I can
throw a ball?

Phil : You... you know what "it" is? It's you crying.

Mitchell : Cam. No, no, no. That's not what he said.

Jay : Which I didn't.
Phil : You teared up.

Cameron : No, apparently, this gentleman doesn't think I can
throw a ball.

Jay : It was the onions.

Mitchell : Oh, that's not what he said.

Phil : Okay, okay. Maybe I'm... maybe I'm just putting myself in
your place, but if I came across something from my childhood,
and it reminded me of my mom, I might get a little misty, maybe
even want to talk about it.

Cameron : You think I can't throw a ball? Well, let's find out! Ugh.

Jay : Here.
Phil : So proud.
Cameron : They offered me a bouquet, Mitchell.

Mitchell : Oo God. He looks old.
Cameron : Oh, sorry!
Mitchell : Cam, hands.
Cameron : Sorry!
Mitchell : There you go.
Gloria : Please forgive me!

Mitchell : Which you accepted.

Manny : I don't think I can. Let's just get in the van. Oh. Sorry for
the rhyme. I know how you "hate my poetry."

Cameron : Why can't you ever take my side? They think of me as a
woman!

Gloria : Please, stop my suffering! Say something terrible about
me so that we can be even like Steven.

Mitchell : Cam, no, come on. We're just a new type of family, you
know? They don't have the right vocabulary for us yet. They...
they need one of us to be the mom.

Manny : Why would I say something terrible to someone I love?

Cameron : So why does it have to be me? Do I wear a dress?
Mitchell : Well...
Cameron : That's a nightshirt!

Gloria : I curse my tongue!
Claire : I'm gonna intervene here. Manny, let's talk about what
really happened, okay? Your mom said you should go out and
throw a ball around. That can't be the first time you've heard that.

Mitchell : It's kind of satiny.

Manny : No. But there was some hurtful stuff said about my
poetry.

Cameron : What are you saying?

Claire : Which your mom regrets.

Mitchell : Come on, you know.

Gloria : I do!

Cameron : No. No, no, no. I don't know.

Claire : So? That's what parents are for. Sometimes they criticize
because it helps make you stronger. Kids these days get... get
trophies just for showing up. What's that gonna lead to? A bunch

Mitchell : All right, if... if I'm thinking about it, of the two of us,
if... if I had to pick, I-I-I might say that you're slightly... mom-er.

of 30-year-olds living at home. Manny, your mom loves you very
much. But she's a human being. So she let off a little steam.
Honestly, it's probably a great thing for your relationship.

Mitchell : Fine. Fine. Me too. But maybe this is what we're seeing,
and I don't know why that's such a bad thing. It certainly doesn't
make you less of a man, right?

Manny : I guess I can...

Cameron : Maybe you're right.

Gloria : Stop. He needs to know the real truth. Manny, Claire was
feeling bad because she wants to hit her own children, so I tried to
make her feel better by inventing terrible things about you.

Mitchell : Yeah. Come on, let's join the party. And, Cam, put down
the scotch. You're not fooling anyone.

Manny : You mean you don't have a problem with my poetry?

Jay : Come on, people! Everybody to the table!

Gloria : No, the only problem that I have is that I never have
enough of it. You're the perfect kid in every way. Ay, mi amor.

Claire : It's just hard, you know? Having your mother's day
ruined. I never thought it would be you, Lucas.

Claire : Wow. That's healthy.

Alex : Don't even think about it.

Alex : Good. You're back.

Luke : But she's sad.

Claire : Uh-huh.

Haley : Sad she's losing. She just hit you with her best shot. We
need to stay strong.

Luke : Are we done?
Claire : Unless the you have something to say to the person who
gave you life on her special day.

Cameron : It is so burn-y. Oh, my God.

Luke : But I feel...

Haley : Nope.

Haley : Don't feel! Just go splash water on your face and man up!
We're your mother now.

Alex : I'm good.

Claire : How was your day with my dad?

Claire : My baby, Luke?

Phil : Awkward, actually. He, um... he cried a little.

Luke : Uh... No.

Claire : My dad?!
Phil : Shh!

Mitchell : Hey. Hey. Here.

Mitchell : Dad what?

Cameron : What's this?

Claire : He cried.

Mitchell : Well, it's a mother's day card. And I know... Stop it!
Okay. Cam, that was Gloria's card from Manny but I just wanted
you to see was its definition for "mother" was on it. It's warm,
nurturing, supportive. You know, maybe when the world sees you
as a mom...

Phil : No, I didn't say he cried.

Cameron : Not just the world.

Cameron : Who cried?
Claire : My dad.
Phil : Stop!
Cameron : Why would you make Jay sob like that?
Phil : I didn't make him sob. He teared up when I found this poem
he wrote for his mom as a boy.
Gloria : What is "ohh"?

Mitchell : Phil saw dad cry.

Jay : You only get one mom.

Cameron : Jay misses his mama.

Jay : Is anybody hungry? What?

Phil : A bottle of red, a bottle of... what?!

Gloria : You cried for your mommy?

Luke : Oh, yeah, and I'm the weak one.

Jay : Oh, crap. I did not.

Manny : All right. Mitchell?

Gloria : Yes, Phil just told us...

Mitchell : Oh, I'm good.

Phil : No, that's not true. She's a liar.
Jay : What's wrong with you? Look, I know you would all be so
happy if you thought I had some big emotional moment about my
mom, but I didn't.
Manny : So you don't miss your mom?
Jay : Of course I do. She was a great lady. And she also left me a
fantastic recipe for sauce, which now is getting cold. So can we
please eat?
Phil : Hear, hear!
Jay : Just grab some wine.
Claire : Oh, my gosh, smell that. It smells like grandma's house.

Claire : Ohh. Phil!
Alex : Oh. Dad!
Claire : Come on, honey!
Phil : I'm sorry.
Haley : Ew, get off of me!
Phil : I'm sorry!
Lily : Dada!
Mitchell : Oh, I think she's calling you.

Jay : Hey, you guys remember that?

Cameron : Don't even try. I have that pottery class in the morning.

Mitchell : I remember the first time I cut spaghetti. That's what
she did! Eh-eh! Yeah, no, you can't cut spaghetti. She taught me to
twirl.

Gloria : Jay, let's go to bed.
Jay : Be right up. Son of a bitch.

Cameron : Oh, so she's the one.
Jay : Yeah, she was tough. I remember I had this little league
coach. And one time after a game, he was laying into me about
something. I don't remember. But mom comes charging out of the
stands. She goes right up to the guy... I mean, face to face, nose to
nose... and she says to him, "let me tell you something... nobody,
and I mean nobody, yells at my little b... boy."

changing, the little pervs!
Manny : Can I just say, in Europe this would be no big deal.

Alex : Mom!
Claire : Luke, keep your pants on, okay?! And, girls, stop getting
so hysterical over everything! Come on! Now, grow up a little! I
need things to start changing around here, or I will change things,
okay? There will be no more TV and no Internet and no whatever
else I can think of. May I have a word with you, Phil?
Phil : I'd rather not.
Claire : What was that?
Phil : Nothing.
Claire : Phil, you sold me out behind my back.
Phil : No! It's just that sometimes you can get a little intense, and I
feel like I need to swoop in to let the kids know they're still loved.
Claire : I could kick you.
Phil : Honey, these are just the parts that we're playing. Am I
wrong, or has it been working? I feel like it's been working.
Claire : I'm tired of being the bad cop. You need to discipline them
sometime and let me swoop in with all the love.
Phil : Shouldn't we just stick with the stuff we're good at?
Claire : Oh, my God! This bathroom is disgusting! The girls told
me they would clean it days ago. I can't yell at them about it one
more time, Phil. You handle it.
Phil : I would, but I promised Luke and Manny I'd take them gokarting for their good report cards.
Claire : What was good about Luke's report card?
Phil : He didn't lose it.
Claire : Let me take them. Yes, let me take them. You stay here.
Hound the girls about cleaning up this mess, and I will take Luke
to do something fun.
Modern Family Season 2x22 page.1

Phil : But... I want to go go-karting.

Alex : This is so unfair!

Claire : Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. This is happening.
Boys! Hey, guys, guess who's taking you go-karting today. Me.

Claire : Come on, guys, let's go have some fun!

Luke : Why? Are we in trouble?

Claire : Oh, you're fine!

Claire : No! You're not in trouble. Today's just all about having
fun! And you know what? Go-karting's just the beginning.

Phil : Have fun, guys.

Manny : What else are we doing?
Claire : Whatever you want.
Luke : I want to bring dad.
Claire : Well, tough. You can't. He's doing something else.
Haley : Goodbye. We will be back in a few hours.
Claire : Oh, whoa! Where you guys going?
Haley : I am taking Alex to the movies, and then I'm going to the
mall.
Claire : How fun! That sounds like fun, doesn't it, Phil?

Luke : Ow! You're hurting me.

Claire : Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Phil : So... how does this usually start?
Guillermo : Good morning, Mr. Pritchett.
Jay : How you doing, sport?
Jay : I didn't know who that was. I never do. At least once a
month, I find a total stranger sitting in my kitchen. Gloria collects
every kind of stray looking for work, money, you name it. She's
got a big heart. It's the one thing I'd like to change about her.

Phil : I'm not much of a shopper, but it would depend on...
Claire : clean bathroom.

Jay : Hey, a dog. That's new.

Phil : Oh. Uh... Girls... How about you clean your bathroom before
you go, huh? It'd really help your mom out.

Guillermo : That was Mr. Pritchett.

Claire : Oh, no. It's not about what mom wants. You mom is cool,
very cool with whatever. It's about what dad wants.

Gloria : Oh, Jay, there you are. Come. I want to introduce you to
Guillermo.
Jay : Just met him. Really hit it off. Honey, keep it under a hundred
bucks, you don't even have to tell me. I'm going golfing.

Phil : Dad wants to go go-karting.

Gloria : No, señor! He's a very nice man that works at the grocery
store and needs a little bit of business advice.

Phil : I would really like it if you would clean your bathroom.

Jay : Oh, why didn't you say so? I thought he was just some nut
who lived behind the dry cleaner's.

Alex : But my movie!
Haley : Why do we have to do it now?
Phil : Because Claire says so. Because I say so. And because I'm
your dad. And I'm older than you, and I call the shots around
here. Right?
Claire : Yes, you do.

Gloria : Oh, that's the guy we bought corrective shoes for last
month. Jay, he knows how successful you are, and all he wants is
an hour of your t... half-hour. 10 minutes. I promise him!
Jay : Honey, I love you, but why do you drag me into these things?
You've got to learn to say no to people.
Modern Family Season 2x22 page.2

Gloria : Fine. Ask me if you can go golfing now.
Jay : Other people.

Cameron : Mitchell, are you hinting that you want to go to that
concert without me?

Gloria : All I want is, when I go to bed at night, to be laying next
to a man that is generous and giving. And that man doesn't
necessarily need to be you.

Mitchell : No! No! Not in a million years! But that's very sweet of
you to offer.

Jay : Okay, let's do this.

Mitchell : Oh, really? 'Cause that just seems like something that
you would say.. "You go, I'll be fine. You spent all the money on
the tickets, and I'm just gonna lie in bed anyways." That's classic
Cam.

Gloria : Okay. Guillermo!
Mitchell : Do you want me to move the waste basket closer to
you?
Cameron : Oh, no. It's fine where it is.
Mitchell : Really? 'Cause the bed kind of looks like a rose parade
float.
Cameron : Thank you for taking care of me.
Mitchell : Well, what else would I be doing?

Cameron : I didn't offer.

Cameron : I'm just so weak.
Mitchell : Okay, good. You know what? It's settled. We're just
gonna put this whole "you insisting I go to the concert without
you" thing behind us.
Cameron : You know what?
Mitchell : What?
Cameron : Can I get one of my little pudding cups?

Mitchell : Um, seeing Lady Gaga, that's what.

Mitchell : Yes, you can. Yes. You eat the pudding, and I'll eat the
tickets.

Mitchell : So, uh, Cam, you know, I hate to bring this up, but what
are we gonna do about that concert?

Guillermo : Thank you for your time, Mr. Pritchett, but after you
hearing my presentation, you will be thanking me.

Cameron : What do you mean?
Mitchell : Well, you know, we were both looking forward to
going. You were looking forward to going. I was really looking
forward to going. And I just... I-I hate to see those tickets go to
waste.
Cameron : I know, I know.
Mitchell : But what are our options? We could both go to the
concert. That's not gonna happen. Uh, well, we could sell the
tickets online. Oh. But there's that Craigslist Killer. Oh, what to
do? What to do? What to do? What to do? What to do? Other
options, other options.

Jay : Well, you've got confidence. I admire that.
Gloria : He admires that, Guillermo. You're doing great. Keep
going.
Guillermo : Are you aware that last year, Americans spent $40
billion on dog training?
Jay : Well, that's not true.
Guillermo : I was surprised as you are.
Jay : No, you were surprised because it's not true.
Gloria : Shh! Go on, Guillermo.
Guillermo : What is this multibillion-dollar industry missing?
Modern Family Season 2x22 page.3

Jay : Multibillion dollars.

Claire : No, I'm just in the car.

Guillermo : I have devised a revolutionary way to communicate...

Mitchell : Okay, I'm having a moral dilemma. We have tickets for
Lady Gaga tonight, but Cam's sick.

Jay : Listen, I hate to interrupt your big pitch, but your dog is
chewing my pillow.

Claire : I'll take them.

Guillermo : This is fantastic.

Mitchell : Wait, you don't even like concerts.

Jay : It's not fantastic for my pillow.

Claire : Yes, I do. I'm fun now.

Guillermo : It's a perfect opportunity for me to demonstrate the
Good Doggie Bad Doggie training system.

Manny : Claire, they said we have to be at least 13 to ride the fast
ones.

Gloria : We're in!

Claire : They're 13. It's fine.

Jay : Wait, slow down. What are we gonna do about the pillow
situation?

Luke : This is very confusing. At movie theaters, she says I'm 11.

Guillermo : Watch, and be amazed. Stella here is being a bad
doggie. Stella, let go. Bad dog, bad dog. Bad dog. And what does a
bad dog get? A bad-doggie treat.

Claire : What?

Jay : Wait a minute. You give her a treat for doing something bad?
Guillermo : Ah, a bad-doggie treat. When she is good, she gets the
good-doggie treat.
Gloria : Brilliant! We're going to be rich!
Jay : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is the difference between a
bad-doggie treat and the good-doggie treat?
Guillermo : Bacon. The bad-doggie treat is very bland.
Jay : But she seems like she likes it.
Guillermo : Wait till you see the good-doggie treat. Stella, sit. Now
a good-doggie treat. Okay, uh, she's still full from the bad-doggie
treat. But there you have it... the Good Doggie Bad Doggie training
system. Welcome to the ground floor.
Jay : Actually, she's peeing on the ground floor.
Gloria : Quick, quick, give he a bad-doggie treat!
Claire : Hello?

Mitchell : Can we get back to me?
Mitchell : Does it make me a horrible person that I kind of want to
go without him?
Claire : Well, how sick is he?
Mitchell : I don't know. He's sick. You know, they're not gonna
make a lifetime movie about him.
Claire : Well, what's he like when you're sick?
Mitchell : Cam, I think I can walk to the kitchen.
Mitchell : He's okay.
Claire : You should go. You know what I learned today? You can't
wait around for somebody to give you something you want.
Sometimes you just have to take it.
Mitchell : Oh, I'm gonna feel so guilty, though.
Claire : You'll resent him if you stay. So, how about this... you stay
home and take care of him... soup, foot rubs, you blow his nose.
Mitchell : Ew.

Mitchell : Hey, it's me. Is this a bad time?
Modern Family Season 2x22 page.4

Claire : He's so lucky to have you. And then tonight, right before
the concert, you say, "Cam, I love you, but I really want to go."
He'll say fine. You drop Lily off at our house, and it's great.
Voice : Drivers, start your engines.
Claire : I'm putting you on speaker.
Mitchell : What are you doing?
Claire : Making my kids love me!

Haley : Oh, my God! Aah!
Phil : Stop this car!
Alex : We're sorry, dad!
Haley : We couldn't hear you!
Phil : No more lies! You poked the bear, girls! You poked him!

Voice : Drivers, ready. Three, two, one!

Guillermo : In closing, the only real question is, after you invest in
Good Doggie Bad Doggie, how will we spend all our money?

Claire : You're going down, Delgado! Like this!

Gloria : In handbags! No, vacation! I know! A home gym!

Luke : Oh, oh, oh, oh!

Jay : All right, Guillermo, your ambition is infectious. Clearly my
wife needs to be inoculated. But I'm gonna be blunt.

Phil : Hey!

Gloria : Ay, no, no, you're not going to...

Alex : We're finished cleaning the bathroom.

Jay : Yes, I am. Now, you wanted my honest business advice,
right?

Haley : We're leaving.
Phil : See? That didn't take too long. Thank you, girls. Now, go
and have a good time, all right?

Guillermo : Very much.

Alex : Bye.

Gloria : No, what Jay means is that when...

Phil : See? You don't need all the conflict. Note to Claire... if you
want intense family drama, rent "Spy Kids." They save their
parents' lives. You think they would've done that if they got yelled
at all the time?

Jay : Here it is. Your idea is not good.
Jay : No, what I mean is it stinks. Now, that's nothing against you.
You've got charm, you've got ambition, and that's great. What you
need is a better idea.
Guillermo : But I don't have a better idea.
Jay : Any idea would be a better idea.
Guillermo : Your honesty is refreshing. Gracias.

Phil : Sweet and sour chicken! Girls! Get back h... Got to fix that
step. Girls!
Alex : Did he just yell? Drive!

Gloria : Ay, you made him cry.
Jay : He's not crying. You're not crying, are you?

Haley : I'm trying!

Guillermo : No. A little. It's just five years of my life are for
nothing.

Phil : You girls get back here right now!

Jay : Five? Five years?

Alex : Pretend you don't hear him.

Gloria : Ay, Guillermo, I'm sorry. Why don't you stay for lunch?
And... and we can all brainstorm your next idea.

Phil : I know you can hear me!
Alex : Oh, my God, he's heading straight for the car!

Modern Family Season 2x22 page.5

Guillermo : Really? Thank you, Gloria. I go put Stella in the car. I
don't want her ruining any more of your beautiful things. Gracias.
Bad dog.
Gloria : Why were you so tough with him? He's very sensitive.
Jay : Did you think that was a good idea?
Gloria : Of course not! But I'm nice, and I put on the sugar jacket.
Jay : Sugar coating is not gonna help him. He needed to hear what
I said to him, even if it hurt a little bit. He's gonna thank me one
day.
Gloria : Ay! Guillermo! Now I have to apologize.
Jay : Accepted.

Claire : Did you finish your milkshake?
Luke : I think that was the problem.
Claire : Look who's a doctor now.
Manny : Maybe it was the pie.
Claire : Oh, he's fine. Hey. Hey, who likes roller coasters?
Luke : I need a bag.
Claire : No. No, you're not gonna be sick, Luke. We're having fun.
Luke : Okay. No, I really need a bag.
Claire : Take the lid off the cup.

Gloria : Not to you!

Alex : I'm starving.

Claire : What are you gonna get, Luke?

Alex : Um, dad? We haven't had lunch yet.

Luke : I want a cheeseburger.
Claire : Yeah!
Luke : And I can't decide between French fries or onion rings.
Claire : Get them both! How about you, Manny?
Manny : Um, do you have a skinless grilled chicken breast?
Claire : What, are you going to the ball, Cinderella? Live a little.

Haley : Me too. Say something.
Phil : Neither have half the kids in Africa. Stop yapping and get
back to work.
Alex : Why is he taping our laptops shut?
Haley : Because he's out of his mind.
Phil : I'm not out of my mind! You took advantage, and you lost
your computer privileges.
Haley : Oh, come on, dad. We said we're sorry. Plus I can't get the
stupid drain unclogged, anyway.

Manny : I know Claire was trying to be fun, but that crossed the
line.

Phil : Stick that hanger down there.

Claire : Anything else? Who wants a milkshake? Milkshake?
Milkshake? Three milkshakes.

Phil : Well, it's either that or we cut off all your hair, 'cause that's
what caused the problem... thoughts? Good, because after you
finish this room, you're gonna clean my bathroom, too, and you
know how gross I can be.

Luke : I didn't really want a milkshake. But after what she said to
Manny, I didn't want to risk it.

Haley : Ew, no!

Alex : Dad!
Haley : Ew ! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!
Alex : Ew! Gross!

Luke : Mom, I don't feel good.
Modern Family Season 2x22 page.6

Phil : All right. Settle down. It's hair.

Gloria : Ay, but look at her little face!

Haley : Oh, my God. I'm not cut out for this.

Jay : No. You don't even want a dog.
Gloria : I know. I have a problem.

Mitchell : I spent all day nursing Cam.

Jay : Oh, crap, that's Manny. If he sees the dog, it's all over.
Gloria : I go lock the door.

Cameron : Ohh. Hey, could you do the right one now?
Mitchell : You mean the one we started with?
Cameron : Sure.
Mitchell : I made soup. I made tea. Finally, it was the moment of
truth.
Mitchell : Cam, you know, I was thinking that... Cam, you can say
no, but I was thinking about maybe going to that concert. Thank
you. You're the best. I love you.
Jay : Hey, you're back. What happened with your friend?
Gloria : He's fine. You were right. He did appreciate your honesty.
Jay : How about that?
Gloria : He's gonna make big changes to his life.
Jay : Good.
Gloria : He's going back to school. That means he has to go back to
live with his sister, so that means that he had to get rid of the dog.
But he's so much more realistic now.
Jay : See that?
Gloria : Mm.
Jay : And there's a lesson in there for you, too, 'cause sometimes
things go better when you just say no. No, no, no. What did you
do?

Jay : Oh, and that's the solution? Manny sleeps in the backyard till
the dog dies of old age?
Manny : Hey, guys. I'm home. Boy, I think Claire's working
through some stuff, because... Oh, my gosh! You got me a dog
because of my perfect report card?
Jay : Gloria?
Gloria : Sorry, papi, no.
Jay : The dog lives somewhere else, which is where she's going
right now. Text me the address.
Gloria : Okay.
Manny : Can I at least take a moment with her to tell her
goodbye?
Jay : Tell her goodbye? You just met her.
Gloria : I'm so sorry.
Claire : Luke, honey, come back. I said I was sorry.
Luke : I'm 12. I need limits!
Phil : What happened?
Claire : Oh, I made them drive too fast and eat like vikings, and
then Luke threw up all over the car. I got to go clean that up.
Phil : No, you don't. Girls! Grab your buckets and meet me by the
car!
Claire : They don't have to do that.

Gloria : Ay! He was going to take her to the pound.

Phil : They do if I say so. I'm sorry. I swear I just told you to grab
your buckets!

Jay : But that's his business.

Alex : We haven't eaten all day.
Modern Family Season 2x22 page.7

Haley : We're hungry.
Phil : Well, you won't be in a minute.
Claire : Honey, you haven't fed them all day?
Phil : They're monsters, Claire... Deceitful,
monsters... and they need to be broken.

Haley : He's crazy!
Luke : You know what?! Mom's the crazy one! She ran over my
hand.
Claire : We were having fun! Girls, go to the kitchen. Get
something to eat. Phil, honey, this isn't working. Listen to me. You

things to go back to the way they were.

have... other strengths. And that's what makes us such a good
couple, you know? But... No, no. It's a cop-out. And I've been very
selfish, and I need to do better, and I will. I swear on Lily's...diaper
bag.
Jay : Ah, wow. Ah, no place to go but up, huh? Don't look at me
like that. We all got problems. This ain't gonna work, sweetie. That
look ain't gonna work on me. Come on. Come on. Let's go.
Gloria : I know it's old-fashioned, but I like a strong man, a man
that can say no when I can't.
Jay : Not a word.

Phil : Yeah. Yeah. I feel really shaky.

Manny : Ay, yes!

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Gloria : But instead, I have Jay.

Phil : I don't like being you.

Jay : I'm strong. But look at this face.

Claire : Nobody does.

Gloria : Maybe we are the way we are because of the people we're
with. Or maybe we just pick the people we need. However it
works, when you find each other, you should never let go. Do you
two need some time alone?

Cameron : Going somewhere?
Mitchell : Cam! You're up.
Cameron : Didn't count on that, did you? Are you dropping Lily
off at your sister's, or is she taking my ticket?

Cameron : Oh. Well... I must've dozed off.

Mitchell : Okay, first of all, how are you standing? You drank
enough of that cough syrup to put down a grizzly.

Cameron : What have you been up to?

Cameron : I'll tell you what's grisly. That is your behavior. Well,
it's just a good thing I'm finding out now, instead of when I'm old
and sick and really need you. Better start saving for some sort of
home-healthcare plan, 'cause I'd hate for my broken hip and
subsequent pneumonia to interfere with your evening plans.
Mitchell : Okay, Cam, no, you're right. You're right. I have no
defense. I am terrible. And the thing is, I knew I was terrible, and I
was going anyway. I think maybe I tried to justify it by saying
we're two different people. And you're more of a caregiver, and I

Mitchell : Yeah, you were out for quite a while.
Mitchell : I've just been sitting here, watching you,
Cameron : Well I'm gonna go to bed.
Mitchell : Okay.
Cameron : Thanks for staying home with me.
Mitchell : Well, you know, in sickness and in health, right?
Cameron : You're still blinking, sweetie.
Mitchell : Oh, no. Oh, gosh. Well, this is... this is funny. I'm gonna
tell you the funny thing about why this is, um... this is on.

Modern Family
2x23 : See You Next Fall

Claire : Honey, are you sure? Because I think they can do school
colors.
Alex : I'm good, mom.

Principal Kaizler : And now, please welcome your valedictorian,
Alex Dunphy.

Claire : Okay.

Luke : Where are my mom and dad?

Phil : Family milestones always throw Claire for a loop. She holds
it in, and then the next day, she has a total meltdown, and I have
to pick up the pieces. Problem is, tomorrow, I'm supposed to go to
Vegas with my buds, so... I need her to melt down today.
Otherwise, what happens in Vegas won't happen to me because I
won't be there.

Phil : And in this corner, finishing first in her class, delivering the
commencement address, weighing in at... What do you weigh,
honey?
Alex : Dad!
Phil : A healthy amount for a girl her age. Are you getting all this,
buddy?
Luke : Pure gold.
Phil : She's the main brain, the cerebellum of the ball, Alex
Dunphy!!
Alex : Oh, keep rolling, the news will want this footage when I
eventually snap.
Haley : I thought Sanjay Patel was first in the class.
Alex : He was until he missed a few weeks and the robot he was
building attacked him.
Phil : It's happening, people. Our hubris will be our undoing.
Claire : Sweetie, what do you say you and I go and get our nails
done, huh?
Alex : It's okay. I want to work on my speech.
Phil : Been there. I remember the speech that won me treasurer of
my high-school Spanish club. "Mi nombre es Felipe. Yo voy a la
escuela..."

Phil : Emotional day, huh?
Claire :Happy day.
Phil : Happy and sad.
Phil : "Guys, I can't go to Vegas because my wife's freaking out!"
Trust me, that is not a phone call you want to make to a bunch of
ex-college male cheerleaders. They will mock you with a hurtful,
rhythmic taunt.
Gloria : Hello?
Jay : Gloria, it's me.
Gloria : Ay! How was the doctor? Can you pick up some bread on
the way home, please?
Jay : I'm home. My damn gate remote won't work. Could you
press...
Manny : Hello?

Claire : Felipe.

Jay : ...9?

Phil : It was kind of a grande deal I was up against an actual
Puerto Rican.

Gloria : Manny, it's okay.

Modern Family Season 2x23 page.1

Manny : What's okay? What's wrong? Where are you calling
from?

Alex : Yep.

Gloria : I'm not calling from. Jay is calling.

Claire : Well, do you need any help? Because sometimes it's great
to bounce ideas off someone whose opinion you value.

Manny : What's wrong with Jay?

Alex : I'm good.

Jay : My clicker won't work.

Claire : Okay. That's cool. Could your hair. We could do it like we
saw in that magazine. Oh, what's that actress... What's her name?...
with the... you know, with the teeth?

Manny : Oh, my God, your heart's not working?! How could you
tell us this over the phone?!
Jay : My heart is fine. Would somebody please press 9 and let me
in?

Alex : Mom, mom, please. I'm... I'm trying to concentrate. Okay?

Gloria : Okay. Got it.

Claire : Okay. Well, you be ready to go in a half-hour, because we
are going to carpool with your grandpa.

Jay : It won't work if you're both on the line.

Alex : Haley's driving me. I want to get there early.

Manny : Okay.

Claire : That's a great idea. Great. I will see you there... Superstar.

Gloria : Okay.

Phil : Hey, mama bear. You okay?

Jay : Every damn time!

Claire : Not with "mama bear" I'm not.
Phil : Don't cry.

Mitchell : Okay, Lily, time to get dressed. Okay.

Claire : I'm not crying.

Cameron : I can't believe Alex is gonna be in High School. I feel so
old!

Phil : Shh! Don't be brave. I'm here for you.

Mitchell : Oh, well, you feel old. I was there when she was born...
in the delivery room. If I wasn't gay before, I...

Phil : Until 2 P.M. tomorrow, when my flight leaves for Vegas.

Cameron : Oh, please, you wouldn't have lasted two minutes on a
farm. I've witnessed all kinds of birthing... never batted an eye.
I've seen cattle, I've seen hogs, I've seen goats... I've even seen a
three-legged... Ohh!

Gloria : Where were you? Did you bring the bread?

Mitchell : Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Jay : I was stuck outside that gate for 10 minutes before it opened.
Gloria : So no bread?
Jay : We got to get that thing fixed.

Cameron : I'm sorry. Really, Mitchell? I could have just died.

Gloria : Ay! What happened to your eye?

[OPENING CREDITS]

Gloria : It's droopy.

Alex : Principal Kaizler, faculty, parents, fellow graduates, it's...

Manny : Aah. I don't like the look of that, Jay. Here, let me check
something.

Claire : Hey, superstar. Oh, you're working on your speech.

Jay : What are you talking about?
Jay : What do you mean, "droopy"?

Modern Family Season 2x23 page.2

Jay ; Put that thing away. I saw my dermatologist. He was
checking for moles or something. He probably got some numbing
cream on it. It's fine! Nothing to worry about.

Haley : No one's ever gonna talk to you again.
Alex : So what? Mahatma Gandhi went on a hunger strike for
what he believed in.
Haley : That's 'cause no one would eat with him in the cafeteria!

Jay : I got botox. Stupid doctor talked me into it, and now it's
drifting. I haven't felt this dumb since I shelled out 30 bucks for
that bracelet that's supposed to give me better balance.
Jay : Try to push my arm down.
Claire : Okay.
Jay : Go ahead. You can't do it. You can't do it.
Claire : Okay. All right. I can't...
Phil : Honey, I'm home. Hey, uh, why is your dad's car here?
Mwah!
Alex : "It's ironic that I stand up he representing my classmates
when, for the past three years, most of them have treated me like
I'm invisible. It's my own fault. I was obsessed with good grades
instead of looks, popularity, and skinny jeans."

Mitchell : Hey!
Claire : Hey.
Jay : Come on over. Have some lemonade and cookies.
Gloria : Jay, that's not looking very good.
Jay : It's fine.
Quick! Who's the president?
Phil : Obama!
Manny : Phil, please. I'm trying to rule out a stroke.
Jay : It's not a stroke. Why does everybody always assume I'm
having a stroke?
Claire : Age.
Manny : Diet.
Gloria : You forgot to bring my bread.

Haley : What?! Is that your speech?!

Mitchell : I'm sorry we're late.

Alex : Get out of here!

Claire : That's okay. We got to leave in about 5 minutes, though.
Luke, stop pushing that ball around! You're gonna fall in.

Haley : You cannot say that!
Alex : Yes, I can! And you want to know why? 'Cause it's the truth.
Haley : No one wants to hear the truth. It's very simple, Alex. In
order to give a good speech, all you have to do is take a song and
say it, like... "Don't stop believin'" or "get this party started."

Cameron : Oh, yes, and then your Uncle Mitchell will laugh at
your expense! I'm just saying it's a character flaw.
Mitchell : Okay, okay, quick poll here. This morning, Cam, fully
dressed...

Alex : That means nothing.

Jay : Thank God it's one of those stories.

Haley : Who cares? Nobody wants to think. It's a graduation, a
celebration of being done with thinking.

Mitchell : ...while in the middle of a very serious thought, fell into
a ducky pool.

Alex : People want to be challenged. They're gonna respect me for
it.

Phil : Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?
Cameron : Yes, I am. Thank you. That is a normal reaction... Love
and concern.
Modern Family Season 2x23 page.3

Mitchell : Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. The pool popped.

Jay : I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Cam. I'm sorry.

Gloria : Ay! Poor thing!

Claire : Oh, my God, dad, your face!

Claire : There is nothing worse than a tailbone injury.

Jay : What? Oh, that's nothing, nothing. It's boring. I went to the
dermatologist. It's a boring story. I'm fine.

Mitchell : Seriously? No, no, no, no. You're so full of it. You know
this is funny. Picture this falling into a tiny pool.

Mitchell : No, no, no, we got to get you to a hospital.

Cameron : He'll be here all week, folks! Literally, because you're
not coming home with me.

Jay : I'm fine.

Claire : There she is. There's my little Stella. That's my girl. Hi,
sweetie. You're so cute, I just wan eat your face!

Jay : Gloria, no, wait.

Phil : You remember when you used to hold Alex like that, and
you wanted to eat her face?
Claire : Yeah.
Phil : Now she's off to High School.

Gloria : Yes, I'm taking you. Come.
Gloria : ¡Vamos!
Jay : Wait right here! Gloria? Gloria?! Gloria? Gloria. Gloria, hold
on. The reason my face looks like this is because I had... botox.
Gloria : Like the ladies use for their wrinkles?

Phil : Time marches on, huh?

Jay : Well, actually, nearly 10% of their sales are men, but that's not
important. I had a bad reaction. Hit a nerve or something. It's
gonna go away soon. What? What's that supposed to mean?

Claire : Yep.

Gloria : Nothing.

Phil : You know what's really sad?

Jay : Would you stop? This is very embarrassing for me.

Claire : What?

Gloria : For both of us. He's fine. It was a false alarm.

Phil : The end of "Titanic."

Claire : What do you mean, a false alarm? His face looks like a
candle.

Claire : Mm.

Manny : Hey, Luke. Do you realize, in two years, you and I will be
graduating?

Jay : You heard her. I'm okay.

Luke : Not now. I think I'm moving the ball with my mind.

Manny : She's not a doctor.

Manny : Well, I'll be graduating.

Jay : Neither are you.

Mitchell : You guys, stop congratulating yourselves for being so
compassionate. If you had been there, you would have laughed
just as hard as I did.

Manny : Technically.

Gloria : He's coming. Stop talking. He's been embarrassed enough
today.
Cameron : Wow. Now it makes sense. It's a Pritchett thing.
Cruelty's genetic. Suddenly it's all very clear.
Mitchell : Be careful. You might run into it.

Mitchell : Okay, look, I don't know what's going on here, but there
is no way that this is normal. You look like a botox job gone
horribly wrong. No... my... God. You didn't.
Claire : Of course he didn't. Did you?
Jay : No.
Claire: You did!
Cameron : What were you thinking? You're a veteran.
Modern Family Season 2x23 page.4

Jay : Enough! This conversation is ended. Let's go.
Phil : Do you think he got his butt done, too? It looks fantastic.
Haley : Alex, wait. I'm sorry. If you want to give your speech, go
ahead. I was never valedictorian. What do I know?
Alex : Thank you! I am doing this for a reason. It's not just like
I'm...
Haley : Aha! Sorry, Alex, but you will thank me one day!
Alex : Please. You really think I don't have duplicates?
Haley : If you do this, you'll be a social piranha.
Alex : Yes, I'll be an Amazonian carnivorous fish.
Haley : Carniv... what?!

Phil : Chun-chunk. Hysterical wife. Hysterical wife. Hysterical
wife. Jackpot.
Claire : Come on. All right. Okay, we have tried this way. I say we
ram the gate. Kids, get out of the way.
Cameron : Hold on! I think I can fix this! I just need a paper clip,
some olive oil, and a ribbon.
Jay : What's the plan, "MacGyver"? Actually, the paper clip is to
connect these two circuits, and the olive oil is to lubricate the
mechanism. And the hair ribbon is for Lily. Her hair's been driving
me crazy all day.
Mitchell : Why don't we just call some cabs?

Claire : Dad, open the gate.

Claire : Because, Mitchell, this is not Times Square, and they'll take
forever.

Jay : Oh, geez, not now!

Phil : Well, then we'll just climb over the fence and start running.

Claire : What? What's happening?

Claire : No, we won't, because it's 5 miles away, Phil! And I'm in
big shoes, so, no.

Jay : It's stuck again.
Claire : What do you mean, it's stuck? Can't you get it open?
Jay : What do you think "stuck" means, Claire?
Claire : We have to do something, dad. Can't you... can't you push
it open or something?
Jay : I don't know!
Claire : We are trapped in your driveway, and you don't know? As
a gate owner, dad, you have a certain responsibility. See, my
daughter is gonna get up on that stage and give a speech and
graduate from Middle School, and if I am not there, dad, I am
going to freak out! I am going to freak out!

Gloria : Wait, wait, wait, wait! I save the day. Let's take this crazy
bicycle, we throw it over the gate, then we take Phil and we take
Claire, and then we throw them over the gate, too.
Mitchell : All right, what the hell is that?
Gloria : Jay bought it. He thought we were gonna use it all the
time, but I keep hitting my boobs with my knees.
Jay : Champagne problems, right? Honey, they're not gonna ride
the bike.
Gloria : Yeah, but I still think that we should throw it over the
gate.

Claire : I am going to freak out!

Claire : Okay, you know what? Thank you. Thank you. Nobody
else has come up with an idea.

Mitchell : Why are you smiling?

Luke : I think I've got a good idea.

Phil : I'm not... I'm not smiling.

Phil : We don't have time to build a rocket, buddy.

Jay : Maybe push it.

Modern Family Season 2x23 page.5

Luke : Never mind.
Claire : Okay. So... Phil and I will go over first, and then you guys
will throw over the bike?
Phil : Okay, step up. I'll boost you.
Claire : Couldn't we get a ladder?
Phil : Please, I'm cheer's squad, I boosted girls bigger than you to
the top of a human pyramid. Now, arms at your side. Straight like
a pencil. One, two... We are bulldogs!
Claire : Aah! Ow!
Phil : She's fine. Okay. Jay, now you do me. Just grab a handful.
Don't be shy. I'm not giving you as much to work with. I used to
have a lot more there. I lost it. They used to call me "The Grand
Can."

nowadays is going off to college, and I don't even know if I can get
into college. Is that enough "stuff" for you?
Alex : Whatever.
Haley : You know what? Fine. Give your stupid speech. Be an
outcast. But you're only doing it to yourself because you're smart
and pretty and sort of funny in a way that I don't really get but
other people seem to enjoy, so, you can either start fresh next year
or be the freak who flipped off her class.
Alex : You really think I'm pretty?
Haley : Shut up!
Claire : Phil, go straight!
Phil : This way's faster!
Claire : No, straight!

Alex : "It's ironic that I stand up here representing my classmates
when, for the past..."
Haley : I read the rest of your speech.
Alex : Congratulations.
Haley : Do you hate me?
Alex : What?!
Haley : You talk about how all the popular kids are shallow and
lame.
Alex : I didn't mean you.
Haley : You think you have everyone figured out, but everybody
has their stuff.
Alex : What "stuff" do you have? Too many boys chasing after
you? Too many parties?
Haley : You really want to know what "stuff" I have?
Alex : Yeah.
Haley : I'm flunking out of biology. And now I have to go to
summer school. My friends... all they can ever talk about

Phil : Stop leaning! Do you want to drive?!
Claire : I do.
Phil : Tough, I called it!
Claire : What was that?!
Phil : Oh, crap. The chain broke!
Claire : Just keep pedaling. It doesn't matter.
Phil : It matters a little!
Mitchell : Cam, please be careful.
Cameron : Why? If I get electrocuted, my hat might blow right off.
That'd be funny as hell, right?
Mitchell : No. No.
Manny : Hey, Jay! I know you're feeling self-conscious, so I dug
out something I thought might help.
Jay : Put that thing away.
Manny : I knew you'd say that, but hear me out. This was
designed to make a hideously disfigured man look supercool. It's
Modern Family Season 2x23 page.6

perfect for you. Oh, yikes. Okay. I'll go upstairs and see if I have a
lefty.

Phil : Alex?

Jay : Don't look at me like that.

Phil : You're not losing her.

Gloria : I have to say that I am a little disappointed in you doing
this thing.

Claire : We are. She's going to High School. This is just when I lost
Haley. This is when Haley went from being my sweet little angel
to being a moody, texting, snotty little princess who hates me.

Jay : Not me. I feel real good about it.
Gloria : Now many times do I have to tell you that you don't have
to look young for me?
Jay : I didn't do it for you.
Gloria : What is her name?!
Jay : Stop. Most of the time, I walk around, and in my head, I'm 40.
Then I look in the mirror, I say, "who's that old man? And what's
he doing in my bathroom?"

Claire : Yes.

Phil : Haley doesn't hate you. And we're not losing her.
Claire : Do you remember when you used to come home from
work and Haley would meet you at the door in her little "Aladdin"
pajamas? And, you know, she'd stick her arms up in the air and
say, "daddy, daddy, take me on a magic carpet ride." Remember
that? When was the last time Haley was that excited to see you?
Phil : I don't remember. It's been so long.

Gloria : Well, it's my bathroom, too. And I like when the old guy is
there. This is the face that I fell in love with. Not this face... This
one.

Claire : We're losing another one. And that's what kids do... they
leave. They leave, and they... and they don't come back.

Cameron : Ooh! Ooh! The gate's opening! The gate's opening!
Mitchell : How did you do that?

Claire : What if they don't, and... and, pretty soon, it's just the two
of us?

Cameron : I didn't do anything.

Phil : I don't want to go to Vegas anymore.

Luke : I did it. I opened it with my mind.

Claire : I know.

Jay : Come on, guys! Let's go, guys!

Phil : I just want to hug them and embarrass them in front of their
friends.

Gloria : ¡Vamos! Manny! Get Manny.
Jay : Everyone in the car. Let's go!
Phil : Yep. That's what I thought. Chain's broken. What do you
think?
Claire : I think we gotta go.
Phil : Sweetie, we... we can't make it on foot.
Claire : We have to try.
Phil : Honey. Honey! It's okay.
Claire : It's not okay, Phil! It's not okay. We're losing her.

Phil : Well, ours will come back, right?

Claire : I know. And Alex... my God. If we miss this speech...
Honey, she's a middle child... she will never forgive us.
Phil : We're not missing that speech! Hello! Hello!
Claire : What's the plan, Phil?
Phil : Mi nombre es Felipe. Yo voy... a la escuela.
Man : You need a ride to the school.
Phil : Yes, please!
Claire : Felipe?
Phil : Okay. ¡Vámonos, muchachos!
Modern Family Season 2x23 page.7

Cameron : This is completely different.
Principal Kaizler : I am so proud to be standing in front of this
extraordinary group of youngsters. I'm sorry... or should I say
"oldsters"? But seriously, the word "commencement" means
"beginning."

Mitchell : How?

Mitchell : I'm sorry I laughed.

Mitchell : Really? Shh! This is about Alex.

Cameron : I don't need an apology, but I will say your behavior
today has been very eye-opening. No offense, Jay.

Alex : …It's ironic that I stand up here representing my classmates
when...they're so... awesome... They should be up here themselves.
But I'm up here, and... I'm sayin'... stuff, 'cause everybody's got
their... stuff, whether you're popular or a drama geek...

Jay : None taken. You look like an iceberg.

Cameron : It's the juxtaposition of absurdist comedy against the
backdrop of a formal setting... Not a big-boned man falling into a
pool.

Claire : Okay. Señor, this is it... right hear, yeah. Okay. Let's go.

Cameron : Oh.

Phil : ¡Muchas gracias, muchachos!

Alex : ...or a cheerleader... or even a nerd like me. We all have our
insecurities.

Man : You're quite welcome!
Principal Kaizler : And now, please welcome your valedictorian,
Alex Dunphy.
Luke : Where's my mom and dad?
Alex : Thank you.
Gloria : Mm... there they are!
Claire : Come on, Phil!
Alex : Principal Kaizler...
Claire : Hold on, Phil!
Alex : ...Faculty...
Phil : Oh, sweet cream! I'm sliding!
Claire : Oh, my God, Phil!
Alex : ...school-board administrators...
Phil : I got you. Get up. Get up. I got you.
Alex : ...Fellow graduates, parents, and everyone who helped us
through these challenging formative years…
Mitchell : Cam! You have lost all credibility.

Cameron : Yes, we do.
Alex : We're all just trying to figure out who we are. I guess what
I'm trying to say is...don't stop... believin'...Get this party started.
Haley : Whoo!!
Cameron : That's so cute.
Alex : Seriously?
Jay : There she is!
Phil : Here's our girl!
Cameron : Your speech moved me.
Gloria : I loved how you play with the song titles. Fantastic.
Haley : My idea.
Jay : You did good, kid.
Alex : Thanks, grandpa. Aah!
Gloria : Don't ask. He'll be fine.
Mitchell : Yes. We are so proud of you. Come here.
Luke : Hello. I opened a gate with my mind.
Claire : What do you say we all go get something to eat?
Modern Family Season 2x23 page.8

Jay : Let's do it.
Alex : A-actually, I was kind of just invited to a party. Would it be
okay if I go?
Claire : Yeah. Of course.
Alex : Yay!
Jay : See you, kid.
Phil : Have fun.
Alex : Thanks for coming, you guys!
Cameron : Bye! Congratulations!
Haley : Hmm. I'm kind of hungry, mom.
Phil : Oh, my God. She's back. My baby.
Haley : What?
Claire : My baby.
Haley : Oh, my God.
Phil : My little baby.
Haley : What are you doing?
Jay : Let's go. Let's go eat.
Haley : I'm not hungry anymore.
Phil : Oh, you're not gonna regret this.
Cameron : I could use some shrimp.
Haley : I'm not hu... I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry anymore.
Claire : Sure you are. Sure you are.
Haley : I'm not... no, I'm not.

Mitchell : Permission to come aboard.

2x24 : The One That Got Away
[OPENING CREDITS]
Luke : Hey, mom... Listen to this card dad got for grandpa Jay.
Phil : "Hip-hip-hip-hooray! Save the extra hip. You'll need it
someday."
Luke : 'Cause he's old!
Claire : Mm. You're not giving him that.
Phil : Even if he drinks his other gift first?
Claire : Nope. Ladies... Do you remember exactly one year ago
today when you did not have a gift for your grandfather and it
killed him just a little, so I suggested you start interviewing all the
members of the family for a video tribute?
Haley : Well, check it and burn... We totally did that.
Alex : Hmm. Almost. We just need to finish the editing. And you
should talk. You haven't even started on your gift yet.
Claire : That's because I changed mine. I thought of a better idea
yesterday.
Phil : I think I came up with a better idea.

Jay : My best birthday memory... I'm a teenager, and for some
reason, I drag this boat out on the lake. And for hours, I'm just
lying there, fishing, alone with my thoughts. Fantastic. That's all I
want this year.
Gloria : So that's really going to be your day? You're going
fishing?
Jay : With time out for a gourmet lunch. Sausage of the month club
really nailed it in may. But, honey, no offense. They almost lost me
last month with that chorizo.
Gloria : Why "no offense"? It's a sausage. It's not on our flag. Lily,
what are you doing here?
Cameron : Surprise!
Cameron : We were just on our way to get Jay's cake and thought
we'd pop by.

Claire : Okay. My dad has a picture of me and Mitchell when we
were kids, standing in our old backyard. We're gonna re-create the
picture.

Cameron : Lily was driving me crazy all morning. I had to get rid
of her.

Phil : I did the same thing last year for my parents for Christmas,
and it went over like gangbusters.

Cameron : She refuses to get dressed.

Claire : Mm. Funny.

Mitchell : Well, did you try bribing her?

Phil : Do you remember?
Claire : Oh, I do. I do.

Cameron : Oh, no. Of... of course I did! I cannot go back in there,
Mitchell.

Phil : Ohh.

Mitchell : Why did we ever decide to have a kid?!
Cameron : I don't know. I don't know!

Claire : Come on, girls, TV off. It's your grandfather's birthday. We
got to start taking this seriously.

Mitchell : Oh, come on!

Modern Family Season 2x24 page.1

Cameron : She loves you so much. Just this morning, she was
looking at a picture of you, and I swear she was trying to say your
name.

Manny : Aren't my thing? I have a tennis racket upstairs I only use
as a bubble-bath frother.

Gloria : Really? Ay, I would love to spend more time with her, but
I have to go to the Mall to get Jay's gift for his birthday.

Manny : How do you put this on?

Cameron : Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. Gloria's busy. No, don't cry. We
should go.

Glen : Excuse me, miss. Sorry. You answered to "miss"!

Gloria : Oh, maybe I can take her wi...
Cameron : Okay. Bag's packed. Have fun. Bye, sweetie.
Manny : Hey, Cam.
Cameron : Oh, hey, Manny.
Manny : Mom, is Jay still here?

Cameron : Wow.

Phil : Aha! Hilarious.
Phil : Glen Whipple, my college rival... Captain of the cheer squad.
Winner of every robot battle. every second I spent with the guy
just made me feel worse about myself. The only thing I could
compete with him in was close-up magic.

Gloria : No, he just left.
Manny : Shoot.

Phil : Well, it's great to see you.

Cameron : Why? What's up, pal?

Glen : Great to see you, too. And I believe this is yours.

Manny : I'm going over to a friend's house where I may have to
use this thing. I only used it once, and that was to take a torte out
of the oven.

Phil : What? When?

Cameron : Okay, well, first, let's loosen this thing up. So what's her
name?
Manny : How'd you know?
Cameron : Well, you're pretending to be something you're not.
Boys do that for girls... or really dreamy boys.
Manny : Her name's Tara. We have great chats online. She's really
smart and funny, but she's on the softball team.

Glen : Hey, you headed over to the card shop? I was in there
earlier. I got myself one of those musical cards. Oh. They're a little
more expensive, but I can swing it.
Phil : Oh. Well, great to see you. Yeah. By the way, don't leave
without this quarter from behind your... come on, Phil!
Glen : Good luck, Dunphy. I'm off to get some new cross-trainers.
I blow through them pretty fast with all this power-walking I'm
into. Catch you later.
Gloria : Phil?

Cameron : Well, nobody's perfect. Hey, you know what? Why
don't we go outside and toss the ball around?

Phil : Hey!

Manny : Okay.

Phil : What are you two doing here?

Cameron : And you know what? I wouldn't worry too much. She's
gonna like you even if sports aren't your thing.

Gloria : Shopping for tonight.

Gloria : Hey.

Phil : Oh, well, I'll walk with you.
Gloria : Where were you heading?
Modern Family Season 2x24 page.2

Phil : The card store.
Woman : What a beautiful child! You and your wife must be so
happy.

Mitchell : I just... I don't see what was fun about that. It made
going in grandma's pool less special.
Claire : Why don't you try being a little less special?
Mitchell : Is it far?

Phil : I didn't think anything of it... Until other people started
making the same mistake. It reminded me of a college job I had
parking cars. One day, I had to park an Aston Martin. I'll never
forget the looks I got driving that baby down the block. I wasn't
gonna dent this one.
Phil : Hey, uh, w-what would you think about swinging by the
shoe store?
Gloria : Okay, let's go.
Mitchell : I still can't believe all the looks we got driving over
here.
Claire : And yet you wore the hat the whole time.
Mitchell : Don't you think we should park on the next block over?
'Cause this is all permit parking.

Jay : Hello.
Sandra : Hi, it's Sandra from the dog groomer. I'm trying to reach
Gloria. Stella's ready.
Jay : Oh, I must have her phone. She probably grabbed mine
again. Listen, this is her husband. You have my number right
there, probably. Give that a call.
Sandra : Oh, Okay, thanks.
Jay : Yeah, it's me again. I'll be right there. Yeah, I did blame her
for no reason. You have a little bit of an attitude. You know that?
You know who did your job in my day? A hose.
Claire : Okay, a little to your left, a little to your left. Yes, okay.
Right there. That's it. That's it. Perfect. Okay. And now I must run.
Mitchell : Here, okay. Fast.

Claire : No, we used to live here. It's fine.

Claire : Here we go. It's weird being back here, isn't it?

Mitchell : Yeah, still. I...

Mitchell : I know. Everything looks exactly the same. Well, you
know, except for the fence.

Claire : I don't think anybody's home. Here. Hang on to this.
Mitchell : What... wait, where are you going?
Claire : The backyard. We'll take this picture really quickly, and
then we'll just get out of here.
Mitchell : No, let's just... let's just wait for them to come home.
Okay, that... that's trespassing!
Claire : No, it's not. We used to live here.
Mitchell : I don't think that does what you think it does.
Claire : Of course you would baby out, because this is just like
pool-hopping all over again.

Claire : Yeah, what's with that? Who are they trying to keep out,
anyway?
Mitchell : I know. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Claire : Oh, wow. Oh, my God. No, it's okay. He might be friendly.
He looks nice. He looks nice. Hi. No! Oh, God! He's... quickly,
quickly. Not nice. So not nice. Hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Now
what do we do?
Mitchell : Well, you could try telling him we used to live here.

Modern Family Season 2x24 page.3

Mitchell : They're never coming home. We need to call someone.
Claire : Use your phone. Mine's down there getting rabies on it.
Mitchell : No, I left mine in your car.
Claire : What?
Mitchell : I didn't want to ruin the line of my pants.
Claire : Oh, God. Oh, look. Somebody's coming.
Mitchell : No. Okay, that is what happens when you park without
a permit. Stop! That's ours! We're up here! Stop! He ignored me.
Claire : He didn't stop for the screaming sailor in a tree? Give me
your shoe.
Mitchell : What, you think that wolf down there is gonna be afraid
of a shoe?
Claire : No. No, I don't.
Mitchell : Wh... what are you doing with dad's wine?
Claire : Getting comfortable. We could be here for a really long
time.
Mitchell : Whoa! Where'd you learn how to do that?
Claire : Where'd you get a sailor suit on short notice?
Mitchell : Fair enough.
Claire : Mm-hmm.
Mitchell : Ew. It's Merlot.
Cameron : Hello. Manny! Hey, how'd it go with Tara?
Manny : It's still going on. The catch part went fine... mostly. I took
a running dive into the dirt.
Cameron : Oh, well, did you at least catch the ball?
Manny : I was trying to throw the ball! I'm in her bathroom
looking for band-aids. I'm trying to get up the nerve to tell her
how I feel.

Manny : She intimidates me. Every time I open my mouth, I say
something stupid. I called her bedroom "fantazing." That's not
even a word!
Tara : Are you okay in there, Manny?
Manny : Yeah! I'm just water-washing my hands! Help me! Tell me
what to say.
Cameron : Okay, how about this... You are the prettiest, smartest,
funniest girl in the sixth grade. I know you're only 11, but I can't
stop thinking about you. I've loved talking to you online. I think
we should become boyfriend and girlfriend. No, it's not what you
think. I'm talking to a little boy.
Jay : Hello. She's not with me, Cam. I got her phone. Why are you
crying? How do you get kicked out of a bakery? Well, that'll do it.
Cameron : I sorry to ask you to get your own birthday cake, but I
can't get ahold of any... anyone else.
Jay : Can't do it. I'm on my way to the lake... Finally. Just get
something at the grocery store.
Cameron : I am not getting you a grocery-store cake. Gloria asked
me to handle this. She's gonna yell at me, Jay. She can be mean in
Spanish!
Jay : Okay, fine. Let's wrap this up, princess.
Cameron : Okay. Love you. Bye.
Luke : What are you guys doing?
Haley : Just editing our birthday tribute to grandpa.
Alex : You know, some of the interviews I did didn't turn out so
well.
Haley : That's okay. We'll just use the best stuff from what we all
got.

Cameron : Well, just be honest.
Alex : Okay, Haley, talk about grandpa.
Modern Family Season 2x24 page.4

Haley : Eww. I can't talk about grandpa dressed like this.

Mitchell : ...And my comic books.

Gloria : I love my... that stupid dog next door! Jay! Jay! Jay!!

Claire : Yep. I think mom and dad would have been a lot more
scared if you hadn't been running into the house to use the
bathroom.

Mitchell : ...Three, four, five.
Alex : Hey, Uncle Mitch, what do you think
Mitchell : One, Two...
Alex : What are you doing?
Mitchell : N-nothing. You didn't see this, and w-we don't tell Cam.
Capisce?
Alex : It'll only take one minute.
Phil : We don't have a minute.
Alex : Who's Clive Bixby?
Phil : A friend of your mom's. Not now!
Alex : Hey, Uncle Cam, can you to talk about...
Cameron : Jay. I know. No time. I got a little girl's birthday party
to save. Skedaddlo... go!
Claire : Oh, not now, honey. Your father's out back. Why don't you
call him? Phil! Dad! Your kids need you!
Luke : Grandpa is really cool. He once let me drink some of his
beer.
Phil : For the love of...
Luke : Root beer!
Alex : I could've sworn we had more!
Luke : Well, let me work my magic. It's all about creative editing.
Just give me two hours and another hour. Somebody get me some
chocolate milk with extra salt.

Mitchell : I can't go outside. Great, now I'm thinking about it.
Claire : Mitchell... It's ironic. We always wanted a dog in this
backyard, and we could never have one.
Mitchell : Y... Manny got one.
Claire : Mm. Manny gets everything.
Mitchell : Yeah. Hey, you think Manny's gonna get a third of...
Claire : A third of what?
Mitchell : You know.
Claire : Oh. Uh...I guess. Sure. I mean, that seems fair, right?
Mitchell : Does it? Claire, does it? 'Cause I just feel like...
Claire : Okay? You know what? I think we've probably had
enough of this.
Mitchell : Okay, wait. Do you think if we could get the dog to
chase this doll, then we could run down and grab the phone really
quick?
Claire : We could do that!
Mitchell : Yeah.
Claire : We just are gonna have to throw it really, really far.
Mitchell : Right. So... That way.
Phil : Gloria, um, I'd still love to swing by that shoe store.
Gloria : If you're in a hurry, go by yourself.
Phil : No. I'll wait. Whipple! Whipple!

Claire : Do you remember the time you quit cub scouts and dad
got mad at you so you ran away up here?

Gloria : Okay! Mm! What do you think?

Mitchell : Right. And you brought me my dinner up here...

Gloria : Bless you.

Phil : Oh, it's perfect. Uh, l-let's see the other side. Whipple!

Claire : Mm-hmm.

Phil : Thank you.

Phil : You remember Claire?

Gloria : It's a little too tight, no? What do you think of the tush?

Glen : Are you kidding? She was gorgeous. God, I was so jealous
of you back then.

Phil : Oh, I think it's great. Why don't you keep it right there for a
second. Let's make sure.

Phil : You were jealous of me?

Gloria : Yeah, but it's a little see-through. Maybe if I put this
underneath, then it won't, like, show.

Glen : Oh, man. Claire Pritchett with the blond hair and those
brown eyes, great smile. Oh, I can picture her smiling right now.

Phil : No, no, no, no, no. It looks good that way.

Phil : I can.

Gloria : I go try something else better.

Glen : I wonder who landed her. Lucky son of a bitch.

Phil : No, wait! Wait!

Phil : Yeah.

Glen : Oh, don't think about it. Just get it.

Gloria : Phil, I need you!

Phil : Hilarious, whipple. I'm actually here with someone.

Phil : What now?! Oh, uh, I'm sorry. I'll be there in a second. No!
How?!

Glen : And you finally did make something disappear.
Phil : She was here a second ago.
Glen : Just like the date you had on the final-night dance of junior
tumbling congress.

Jay : What the hell were you thinking? I'll answer that for you. You
weren't thinking. You think that's funny, Popeye?

Phil : There was traffic.

Mitchell : No.

Glen : Sure.

Claire : Popeye.

Gloria : I think I found something that is going to make my
husband very happy. What do you think?

Jay : I should be fishing, but I'm hauling my ass across town trying
to save you two from a little dog.

Phil : Oh, very happy, Gloria. Very happy.

Mitchell : At least we got to have a dog for a few minutes.

Gloria : Okay, but don't go far away because I might need help
with the zipper, okay?
Phil : Sounds good... with the zipper.
Glen : Wow. Phil. I mean, wow. That's your wife?
Phil : It would appear so. Great to see you, Glen.
Glen : Ohh. Hmm. You know, I got to say, I'm a little surprised.
Phil : Surprised... Or mystified? Damn it. It went down your shirt.
You can... keep it. I'll see ya.
Glen : No, no. I just always assumed you would marry Claire
Pritchett.

Jay : There we go. You could show a little gratitude, you know.
These pants are new. Climbing over that fence, I might have
wrecked 'em. That's mature.
Mitchell : I'm sorry. We're sorry.
Claire : I'm so... we're sorry.
Mitchell : I'm sorry you said "rectum."
Claire : I'm sorry, dad. Um, we're so glad that you came and got
us. - Thank you. It was very smart the way that you distracted the
dog.
Jay : 12 times a year, I get sausages. That's it. What the hell am I
gonna to do till June?

Mitchell : Hey.

Cameron : Yeah. I just bet you need some time in a batting cage.
What are you doing this weekend? That'd be fun, huh?

Gloria : Let's see it. It's beautiful.

Manny : That's a great idea! I'll ask Jay. He loves stuff like this.

Mitchell : We just need some candles.

Cameron : Oh. That'll be great for you guys.

Gloria : I-I must have in one of the drawers. Okay. Froot loop
necklace... Baby Jesus... ...key... ay, I was looking for these keys.
Baby Jesus... BB Gun... More baby Jesus... Ay, another baby... Jesus,
Stella! Don't do that!

Manny : Yeah. And thanks for your help today, Cam.
Cameron : You got it.

Jay : Gloria?

Luke : I don't think grandpa's having the best time. He keeps
going and getting more drinks.

Gloria : No, Jay! Don't come in here! You cannot see the cake! It's
the bad luck!

Haley : Well, not every time. One time he went in to check on the
women's basketball score.

Jay : I already saw the cake. I bought it while I was busy not
fishing.

Jay : The Sparks are up by 8, if anyone cares.

Gloria : No. Go out to the bar. Go!
Jay : You never used to talk to me like that before we got that
damn dog.

Claire : Okay, dad, we all owe you an apology. We were so
worried about giving you a great night that we ruined your day,
and I'm really sorry we didn't let you go fishing.
Mitchell : Sorry, dad.
Cameron : Sorry, Jay.

Cameron : Hey, Manny. I almost called you. How'd it go with
Tara?
Manny : Okay, I guess. I used every line you gave me, and she
totally ate it up.

Jay : You know what? I'm acting like a jerk. What am I, 12?
Luke : Hey.

Cameron : Oh. Well, then, why just okay?

Jay : So I didn't get to go fishing. What, am I gonna pout about it? I
still have my family, and you guys made such a big fuss. I love
you all.

Manny : She wants to go on a date now... to the batting cage.

Claire : Aww.

Cameron : Ohh. Not so good with a bat?

Jay : So let's go get some cake and presents.

Manny : I am, as long as I'm using it to roll out dough.

Claire : Yes! Cake and presents! Come on, everybody!

Cameron : I'll bet you just need a little practice. You know, when I
was your age, I couldn't hit a balloon with a bat. Then my father
took me out to the field, and a couple hours later, I was knocking
the hide off that ball. It's one of the best days we ever had together.

Phil : Honey?

Manny : Really?

Claire : Yeah?
Phil : Have I told you how lucky I am to have you? Gloria, excuse
me. 'Cause I am.
Claire : Okay.
Cameron : Hap...
Modern Family Season 2x24 page.7

Jay : No singing. What the hell happened to the cake?

Claire : Dad!

Gloria : Nothing. It's beautiful. Okay, let's open the presents.

Cameron : Jay!

Claire : Yes! Presents! Who's first?

Gloria : Jay!!

Gloria : Mine first. Mine first.

Luke : Grandpa...

Mitchell : And as you know, Claire and I. ...We didn't quite finish
ours, but we will be getting that to you.

Mitchell : We...

Jay : Fine.

Haley : Eww!

Phil : And our gift is a fuller version of that and a card.

Mitchell : Capisce?

Phil : Love...

Jay : Wonderful.
Cameron : And, of course, the cake is, uh, mine.

Luke : Well, who wants to see it again?

Jay : Fantastic. And here we have a phone... In the shape of a
mouth.

Alex : That's it? That's all you used? I wasn't even in it!

Gloria : Ah, you're welcome! Very sexy!
Jay : Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me. Let me work this out. I
mentioned a few times that I was thinking of taking up the
saxophone, and you give me this. I got it! Is this a sexy phone?!
Gloria : Happy Birthday!!
Claire : Wow.
Jay : All right, what else we got?
Claire : Oh, uh... N-nothing. Hmm. Maybe not a perfect showing
on behalf of the adults in the family, but don't forget the kids still
have their big gift.
Alex : And it took us a year to make.

Haley : That totally sucked.
Jay : You know what? Great party. Thank you all for coming. And I
hope you forgive me. I'm gonna go upstairs, curl up with a
ludlum, and call it a day. Hello. Manny? Where are you? What are
you doing out there? What the hell?
Manny : I dragged it back here this afternoon. I know it's not the
lake, but maybe we could pop open a few drinks and hang out on
the water?
Jay : Now, the old Jay would have said, "I wanted to be on a lake
with a fishing rod and sunshine, not bobbing around at night in a
swimming pool." I miss the old Jay.

Luke : It's in the DVD player. You've got to come watch it.
Mitchell : Okay.

Manny : This is the life, huh?

Gloria : I'm so excited! Let's go, Jay! And bring your sexy phone.

Jay : It ain't half bad.

Jay : Oh, don't forget that.

Gloria : Ay, I want to get in the boat!

Mitchell : Okay, and... and, uh, we all participated, so this is kind
of from all of us.

Jay : Captain?

Luke : Yeah. Hit the lights!

Alex : Me too! I want to get in!

Manny : All right.

Modern Family Season 2x24 page.8

Cameron : So, how was your day with Claire?
Mitchell : You know, it was actually... It was really great. I don't... I
don't always think about it, but I-I was really lucky to have her to
grow up with. You know, I cannot imagine dealing with my crazy
parents alone.
Cameron : Yeah.
Mitchell : Cam?
Cameron : Hmm?
Mitchell : I... I want to have another baby.
Cameron : What would you think about a boy this time?
Jay : All right, easy !
Gloria : Ay!
Jay : Easy! Easy!
Gloria : No, no, no! You're rocking the boat!
Phil : I got Claire! I got Claire!
Mitchell : All right, ahoy! So, if we all just, uh...
Claire : Okay, everybody... upstairs and, Luke, I want you to get in
a hot bath right away.
Luke : I'm still shivering.
Claire : Ohh.
Alex : That's why you don't stand up in a boat.
Luke : I was king of the world.
Haley : Well, now you're dork of the night.
Phil : Honey... Have I told you how lucky I am?
Claire : You mean since dinner?
Phil : I can't help it... your beautiful eyes, your silky hair. Promise
me you'll never... change.
Claire : I have to admit, that's kind of hot. Maybe I will go change.
Phil : I still got it. Knock it off!
