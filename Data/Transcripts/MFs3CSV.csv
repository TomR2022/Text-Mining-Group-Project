It's just like when Claire didn't even know you dumped her.","Mitchell : The word ""fired"" doesn't even apply. You can't get fired from a favor.","Mitchell : Okay, you... You've never said that, but... And... and what about this grudge you're holding against Claire? I don't see you trading that in for a tune.","Mitchell : Which, you have to admit, you can be pretty defensive about.","Mitchell : N-no. No. Mnh-mnh. No. These... these are... these are not equal. No, you have no idea what it feels like to be fired.",Mitchell : Yeah.,Mitchell : Not me.,"Mitchell : No. Nope, I've always been very good at what I do.",Mitchell : That's hogwash.,Mitchell : Hmm?,Mitchell : Is the repair guy here?,Mitchell : You woke me up to tell me that?,"Mitchell : I was doing you a favor.
