### Text-Mining-Group-Project
Tom, Yop, Nick

Title - Modern Family character analysis utilising text mining methods.

Abstract:


The Transcripts are compiled into several CSV files seperated by season, after removing all lines not stated by the main cast, then normalizing and semmatizing them. Then the Character Name, and the Line, Normalized Line and Semmatized Line are all placed in a row for processing.


Potential Additions:
- Character Analysis
  - Per Character, we can see the most common words and see how they've fluctuated throughout the airing of the show.
  - We can additionally use general sentiment analysis to see how 'positive' or 'negative' each character is based upon their most frequent words.


Research gap:
- We have found limited NLP and sentiment analysis research conducted on TV shows, with only the shows Friends and The Simpsons previously explored. 

Research questions:

- Can we utilize classic text-mining Techniques to conduct analysis on characters of the show Modern Family?
- 

Datasets:

- Modern Family Transcripts

- Twitter Sentiment Analysis Training Sets
