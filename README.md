Title - Modern Family character analysis utilising text mining methods.

Abstract:




Utilizing Text Mining methods we have learned in class, available Modern Family transcripts, and a data set of google's most relevant searches this group will be attempting to see how 'Modern' Modern Family was through it's years airing, as well as viewing how the characters were represented over the years.

The Transcripts are compiled into several CSV files seperated by season, after removing all lines not stated by the main cast, then normalizing and semmatizing them. Then the Character Name, and the Line, Normalized Line and Semmatized Line are all placed in a row for processing.

From there, it only requires us to find each character's most common words per episode and per season, ignoring all stop-words. 

Afterwards: We can compare the most spoken words per episode/season and compare them to the most searched phrases on google the year of and before the release of that season(to take production times into account).

Potential Additions:
- Character Analysis
  - Per Character, we can see the most common words and see how they've fluctuated throughout the airing of the show.
  - We can additionally use general sentiment analysis to see how 'positive' or 'negative' each character is based upon their most frequent words.


Research questions

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

- How Modern is Modern Family? (How do the show's character's most frequent spoken words compare to the most frequent google searches in the same year? Is there correlation?)

- Can we utilize Classic Text Mining Techniques to conduct character analysis for shows such as Modern Family?

Datasets:

- Modern Family Transcripts

- Google Trends

- General Sentiment Analysis Training Sets
