Title - How Modern is Modern Family?

Abstract:

Utilizing Text Mining methods we have learned in class, available Modern Family transcripts, and a data set of google's most relevant searches this group will be attempting to see how "Modern" Modern family was through it's years airing, as well as viewing how the characters were represented over the years.

The Transcripts are compiled into several CSV files seperated by season. But not before removing all lines not stated by the main cast, then normalizing and semmatizing the lines. Then the Character Name, and the Line, Normalzied Line and Semmatized Line are all placed in a row for processing.

From there, it only requires us to find most common non-stop words spoken per episode, season and by character. 

Afterwards: We can compare the most spoken words per episode/season and compare them to the most searched phrases on google the year of and before the release of that season.

Potential Additions:
- Character Analysis
  - Per Character, we can see the most common words and see how they've progressed throughout the airing of Modern Family
  - We can additionally use general sentiment analysis to see how 'positive' or 'negative' each character is
