Title - Marvel vs DC Twitter sentiment analysis

Abstract

A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

Utilise a Twitter crawler to gather information and create our own dataset

Crawl tweets about Marvel and DC separately, compare sentiments to both franchises.

When manual sentiment analysis is done, we have an algorithm determine the sentiment of a larger batch of tweets for both Marvel and DC

Afterwards: Compare the sentiments weâ€™ve found to each other, graphing how many people feel about each franchise on a scale of 1 to 5. (Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive)

Potential Additions:
Utilise Geotaggers to mark down specifically where people find DC and Marvel appealing
Can focus on certain languages other than english, although this may prove difficult as we are conducting the sentiment analysis ourselves.


Research questions

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

How has the frequency and sentiment analysis of Marvel changed over time as it's cinematic universe (movies) has increased in size and popularity?
Has one franchise always been favoured or typically had more positive sentiments than the other? 

Dataset 

We have decided to use a web crawler to gather data for us. Therefore we will not be using a pre-existing dataset.
